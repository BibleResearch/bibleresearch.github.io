There are three goals for this project:\n\nTo glorify God by increasing in our ability to interpret, understand, and apply of His revealed word.\n a. Increasing in our ability to properly interpret God's word glorifies Him by allowing us to then understand and apply His word properly. Interpretation is the initial step of going from words on a page to meaning and significance. If the intepretation is wrong, the understand and application that follow will likely be incorrect as well and visa-versa. Unfortunately, we, as the Church, never teach anyone how to read and interpret the Bible. We tell people that they ought to set aside time each day to read the Bible and that the Bible is very important because it is revelation from God (we answer the \"what?\" and \"why?\"), but we never talk about how we should interpret the Bible. How do I rightly interpret a book written thousands of years ago by an ex-egyptian prince wandering in the deserts of Arabia and Mesopotamia? This is a very valid question and one that the Church is largely unable to answer. We need to learn what the Bible is supposed to be teaching us, what questions to ask when we come to the Bible, and how to interpret a text as God intended and as glorifies Him.\n b. Increasing in our understanding glorifies God by allowing us to think rightly about Him, what He has done, is doing, and will do. If we do not think of God as the author of aesthetics and beauty, we will have no way to fully appreciate a beautiful statue or purple sunset. If we do not think God is faithful to His promises, there is no reason for us to pour ourselves out in His service. To be clear, when I refer to \"understanding\", I am not referring to an understanding of Bible trivia (e.g. How many people made up the people of Israel when they went into Egypt? How many people made up the people of Israel when they left Egypt?). I am referring to an understanding of who God is and what He has done. In other words, understanding the theology that is derived from the text of Scripture and questions like those listed above.\n c. Increasing in our application of the word of God is also critical and is the logical extension of the point above (the one about understanding God's word). If we are to glorify god, it is not enough to only understand what a text meant in relation to the original audience. We must be certain to establish this, but must then press on to understand the theology of the passage and to bring our lives into alignment with that theology. Notice that I choose my words carefully here. It is not as though we are reading the Bible and then seeking to apply what we have read to our lives. This is the wrong way to do things. It presumes that the theology presented in the Bible has no real bearing until it is brought to bear on my own life. This is simply not the case. In reality, the theology of the Bible is absolutely true an, therefore, absolutely relevant and applicable. It is not the Bible that must be applied to your life, but your life that must be measured and considered in light of the truth of Scripture. This is the type of application that glorifies God.\n\nTo help the Church become more familiar with the entire Bible. For many Christians, the Bible primarily consists of well-trodden paths like Romans, the prison epistles, maybe a select Gospel, and maybe Genesis and Exodus (and how could I forget the Psalms!). Outside of these books, there are a lot of dark, unknown places in the Bible (especially the Old Testament). Unfortunately, those dark, mysterious places make up the bulk of our Bibles and lay the groundwork for the books we so cherish. In my opinion, our narrow diet of books is an affront to God's sovereignty in revealing and preserving the books of the Bible we have today. If it was important enough for God to both reveal and preserve the book of Leviticus for us today, don't you think we can learn something from it as we are promised in 2 Timothy 3:16?\n\nTo help the Church fear, love, and worship God more. Through this study, it is my hope that believers are struck by the attributes and actions of God in such a way that they grow in their relationship with God. Understanding God's holiness in a book like Leviticus should lead us to fear Him. Seeing a plan of redemption established in Genesis chapter three should elicit praise and worship. Seeing the prophecies of all that the Messiah will accomplish in Isaiah should lead us to love God more. It is my hope that this study is fodder, not only for intellectual growth, but also for spiritual growth.\n\n\n"},"preface/methods.html":{"url":"preface/methods.html","title":"Methods","keywords":"","body":"Methods\nHow do I intend to reach my objectives?\n\nPractice proper interpretation.\n\n"},"old_testament/":{"url":"old_testament/","title":"Old Testament","keywords":"","body":"The Old Testatment\n(Genesis - Malachi)\n"},"old_testament/pentateuch/":{"url":"old_testament/pentateuch/","title":"Pentateuch","keywords":"","body":"Pentateuch\nThe word 'pentateuch' comes from GK. πεντάτευχος, meaning \"five scrolls\"\n(Genesis - Deuteronomy)\n"},"old_testament/pentateuch/genesis.html":{"url":"old_testament/pentateuch/genesis.html","title":"Genesis","keywords":"","body":"Genesis\nAuthorship and Audience\nAccording to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), Moses wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). Thus, Moses is likely the author as I see no reason to diverge from the traditional position. If Moses wrote the book, the most direct audience would have been the people of Israel. Genesis serves as an introduction to how the people of Israel came to be and what God plans to do through her. Given the universal importance of creation and the promise of redemption (Genesis 3:15), however, it is easy to see how all of humanity is the indirect audience of this book.\nDate and Context\nAssuming Moses wrote the book, Genesis would have been written during his lifetime, many have suggested during the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness. In order to nail down a date for Moses life, it is helpful to identify the date of the exodus from Egypt. This is the subject of significant debate as some hold to an \"Early Exodus\" claiming that the exodus occurred around 1446 B.C., while others hold to a \"Late Exodus\" claiming that the exodus occurred in the later half of the 1200s BC. The details of this debate are beyond the scope of this discussion, but I hold to an \"early exodus\" which would put the date of this book likely between 1445 and 1400 BC. Assuming the book was written during the wilderness wandering, the book would have been written during a time of spiritual formation in Israel's history. Israel was still trying to figure out who she was as well as how she ought to follow God.\nTheological Theme(s)\n\nBeginnings. Genesis, which itself is a word that is transliterated from the Greek for \"coming into being\", is all about beginnings. Within the first three chapters of Genesis, we see God create the universe and make a promise to redeem. If you think of the Bible as a play, in Genesis 1-2, we have the setting and cast introduced. In Genesis 3, the plot is introduced. The plot of God's salvation of mankind is the central theme of the Bible and human history... and it all starts in the Garden in Genesis. Genesis begins when the universe was not and ends with an earth full of rebellious men to whom God has made promises. Genesis is all about beginnings. And not just beginnings that occur out of thin air. The beginnings in the book of Genesis start with God (see the point below for more on this).\nGod's Action in the Universe. The worldview presented by the book of Genesis is that God is intimately involved in and in control over His creation. He did not create the universe and then step back. He is not just one of many participants with relatively equal power in the universe. Throughout the book of Genesis, God is, by far, the most active and powerful character. He creates the universe, makes a garden, makes man, makes woman, makes marriage, reveals the coming flood to Noah, shuts the door of the ark, calls Abraham, changes Abram's and Sarai's names, makes a unilateral covenant with Abraham, names Ishmael and Isaac, reiterates Abrahamic covenant to Isaac, chooses Jacob over Esau, changes Jacob's name, reiterates Abrahamic covenant to Jacob, and works through the treachery of Joseph's brothers to save them (among many other things). In short, the main character of the book of Genesis is God and not Noah, Abraham, Isaac, nor anyone else.\nHow Will God Deal with and Relate to Evil? This is one of the essential questions we must ask when reading Genesis. The story starts with a fall and through out the book we find that some of the primary characters are sinful and fallen. One of the major questions is: Can God still bring about His promises and plan even though man is sinful? The great hope of the book of Genesis is that God shows Himself to be bring about His will even while facing opposition from sinful man. This hope is summarized by Joseph in Genesis 45:5 and 50:20 where he points out that the treachery his brothers meant for evil has been used by God for good. In a sense, this is the hope of the book of Genesis: that God can and will use even evil for His good purpose and plan.\nGod's Choice of Israel. The two themes mentioned above become focused together in the book of Genesis to describe how God is at work in choosing and forming the beginnings of a new nation: Israel. We watch as the seed of Adam and Eve, promised to one day crush the head of Satan (Genesis 3:15), grows and expands. We watch as God makes covenants and promises to those he chooses. God miraculously gives Abraham and Sarah a child. God chooses to exalt Jacob above Esau. God uses the treachery of Joseph's brothers to send him into slavery in Egypt where he will ultimately save his people from famine. Through the book of Genesis, we are watching the formation of a nation by God's design.\n\nOutline\nThe outline below is based around the phrase that is usually translated into English as \"These are the generations of ...\" or \"This is the account of ...\". This phrase occurs ten times throughout the book of Genesis and is, I believe, the best way to structure the book. The Hebrew word used for \"generations\" that is used in each of these instances is transliterated as \"Toledot\".\n0. Primeval History [1 - 11:26]\n\nA.

The spirit of God hovers over the unformed earth (Genesis 1:2) and God is recorded as referring to Himself in the plural (1:26).\nIn today's culture, the debate between naturalism (often represented by evolution) and super-naturalism has put a lot of focus on the creation account (and this is not a bad thing). If we just look at the text, however, and consider the fact that the original audience in the Ancient Near-East would have been familiar with other creation stories, we notice that the creation account recorded in Genesis 1 is actually very short and concise. We do not get a lot of details regarding why or how God creates. And I believe this is intentional as it God is the one with the prerogative to do as He pleases by nature of the fact that He is the pre-existent creator.\nOn the note of the cursory nature of the creation account, notice that the sun and moon are not even mentioned by name (see Genesis 1:14-16) and the creation of the stars is described in three words (as it is translated into English in the NASB) (\"the stars also\": 1:16).\n\nThe Fall\n\nWhen we, as Christians, think of the Fall, we often think of Satan and his role in the whole fiasco, but we often forget that something was also going on in Eve's heart and mind (the critical verse in Genesis 3:6).\nNotice how Eve's lust in Genesis 3:6 parallels the description of all the other trees in the Garden (see 2:9). To Eve, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, from which they were prohibited from eating, was \"good for food\", \"a delight to the eyes\", and \"desirable to make one wise\" (3:6). The rest of the trees in the garden, however, were described by God in a similar way as being \"good for food\" and \"pleasing to the sight\" (2:9). It wasn't as though the trees in the Garden were a bit ugly and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a rare beauty...  all of the trees were \"pleasing to the sight\" (2:9). In the same way, it is not as though Adam and Eve did not have enough food or good enough food. The trees of the garden are described by God as being \"good for food\" (2:9). Eve's observation that the forbidden tree was a \"desirable to make one wise\" is also interesting if, as I presume they did (based on Genesis 3:8), Adam and Eve had personal interaction with God Himself. They had access to the source of all wisdom but instead rejected that wisdom to seek another. Thus, we see that the nature of sin is not only disobedience to God, but is also a willful rejection or twisting of God's gifts and plans.\nGenesis 3:15 is God's promise of redemption after the fall. It is often called the \"protevangelium\" (meaning 'first gospel' or 'early gospel'). It is worth noting that this promise of salvation through the seed and Satan's defeat comes before God has called any specific nation. That is to say, this promise is in play for all of descendants of Adam and Eve and not just Israel. God will bring His seed (singular; that is, Jesus Christ) will come from Israel, but the defeat of Satan will liberate the seed (plural; that is, some of the descendants of Adam and Eve).\n\nAbraham\n\nThe covenant with Abraham, ratified with the ceremony described in Genesis 15:7-21, is very interesting for two reasons. First, it takes the form of a standard covenant ceremony in the Ancient Near East. In that time, a covenant between two parties was ratified by killing animals, cutting them in half, and splitting up each half, thus forming a path between the animals. Each party involved in the covenant would then walk through the path between the dead animals signifying their commitment to the covenant on pain of death. The idea is that if one party breaks the covenant, they acknowledge that they can be killed as the animals. A covenant in that day (as today), was a serious thing. Second, the ceremony described in Genesis 15:7-21 is interesting because it breaks the normal pattern of covenants. In this passage, a deep sleep falls of Abram (15:12) and only God walks between the animals. Thus, God is making a unilateral and unconditional covenant with Abram. It is entirely up to God to fulfill that which he promised.\n\nGeneral\n\nNotice who is naming things throughout the book: God. God names the various constructs of His creation like light, dark, day, night, and man (Genesis 1). God changes the names of Abram (to Abraham in Genesis 17:5) and Sarai (to Sarah in 17;15) as well as changing Jacob's name to Israel in 32:28-29. God provides the names for both Ishmael (Genesis 16:11) and Isaac (17:19). From the very beginning of the Bible, the name of a thing is very important as well as the one from whom the name was derived.\nBuilding off of the last observation, numerous names of God are used in the text. In Genesis one, the word used for God is \"Elohim\". In Genesis two, \"Yahweh Elohim\" is used. God reveals His name to Abram as \"Yahweh\" (Genesis 15:7). In my estimation, there are two things particularly worthy of note in this observation:\nFirst, God takes it upon Himself to reveal Himself. There is no way for humans to know Him personally without His intervention. God revealed His name to Abraham and through inspiring the book of Genesis itself, He is revealing more of Himself.\nSecond, while the human characters in Genesis only have one name (although that name is sometimes changed), God has many names which is a testament to His complex and infinite nature.\n\n\n\n"},"old_testament/pentateuch/exodus.html":{"url":"old_testament/pentateuch/exodus.html","title":"Exodus","keywords":"","body":"Exodus\nAuthorship and Audience\nAccording to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), Moses wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for Genesis for more details.\nDate and Context\nAssuming Moses wrote the Pentateuch, it would have been written during Moses' lifetime. Refer to the notes for Genesis for a discussion of when this may have occurred.\nTheological Theme(s)\n\nGod claims Israel as His People. Although we have traced the development of the line of Israel in Genesis, it is not until the book of Exodus that God officially claims Israel as His own and forms a covenant with her. Exodus 1 through 15:21 detail God's liberation and defense of his people. In Exodus 4:22-23, we see that God is treating Israel as His own, firstborn child. As such, we see God as a King who doing battle with Pharaoh and the Egyptian Gods for the sake of His people. For example, in Exodus 12:12 God describes the killing of all the firstborn in Egypt as a judgement \"against all the gods of Egypt\" (see also Numbers 33:4). In Exodus 3:20-22, God promises Moses that Israel will \"plunder\" the Egyptians as they leave Egypt (which comes true in 12:35-36). In Exodus 5:1-2, Pharaoh refuses to recognize Yahweh's authority and let His people go free. The first portion of the book of Exodus is presented as a war between two gods (God and Pharaoh). God is defending His people because they are considered His firstborn son (see 4:21-23) and He is working to fulfill the promises He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (see 6:7-8).\nHow can a Holy God relate to an Unholy People? From Exodus 15:22 through the end of the book, Israel has been liberated from Egypt by God and a question quickly arises. If Israel is unfaithful, how can God (who is holy) dwell with this people (who are unholy)? In Exodus 15:22 - 34, God's standards are laid out and we clearly see that Israel will be unfaithful to God. In fact, Israel's quickness to be unfaithful to God as described in Exodus is truly stunning. To cite a few examples, consider the golden calf incident. In chapter twenty four of this book, Israel ratifies a covenant with God (see Exodus 24:7-8). After Moses goes back up onto Mount Sinai for forty days to receive the plans for the tabernacle, the people violate the second commandment by creating an idol to represent God. Only forty days and the people are breaking the second commandment! For another example, notice the dramatic shift from praising God for His power in 15:1-21 to grumbling in 15:22-27. This is graphic testimony to the depths of man's sinfulness and inability to faithfully follow God of ourselves. With this in mind, the rest of the book of Exodus begins to lay out some guidelines for how the holy and faithful God will relate to His unholy and unfaithful people. We see this evidenced in the instructions for the tabernacle and the start of the sacrificial system.\n\nOutline\n0. Israel in Egypt [1 - 15:21]\n\nA. Introduction [1]\nB.

He is also the one who establishes the basis of the relationship between Israel and Himself. This is important to notice. Israel was not able to set the standards for how they would interact with God. They could only come to God on His terms.\nWhen we consider the depth and speed of Israel's changes from worship to sin, let us not think for a second that we are exempt from the same exact behavior. As Israel did, so would we have done and so would we be doing still but for the grace of God. Any faithfulness in us is only present because God is at work in us (see Philippians 2:12-13).\nIsrael's inability to keep a covenant with God lays the groundwork for the book of Leviticus and the rest of the Pentateuch which establishes how a holy God can live in the midst of this people without killing them.\nIn Exodus 34:11-17, God warns Moses about the dangers of idolatry which Israel will face when they enter the promised land. In this passage, God establishes that to worship the idols of those living in the promised land is to \"play the harlot with their gods\". In other words, following any other God but the true One is spiritual adultery. Sin, especially that of idolatry, really is a big deal. Take a moment to consider the fact that we are not exempt from idolatry even though very few of us would consider worshiping a golden calf. Idolatry doesn't require a golden calf. As Paul says in Colossians 3:5, \"Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and greed, which amounts to idolatry.\" (emphasis is mine). Greed for money, power, sex, fame, you-name-it is idolatry. You are no longer worshiping the true God who is worthy of our worship, but are committing adultery with gods of your own making.\n\n"},"old_testament/pentateuch/leviticus.html":{"url":"old_testament/pentateuch/leviticus.html","title":"Leviticus","keywords":"","body":"Leviticus\nAuthorship and Audience\nAccording to tradition (both Jewish and Christian), Moses wrote all of the books in the Pentateuch (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy). See the notes for Genesis for more details.

Refer to the notes for Genesis for a discussion of when this may have occurred.\nTheological Theme(s)\n\nClean and Unclean. When reading the book of Leviticus, the words \"clean\" and \"unclean\" should jump off of the page. The word \"unclean\" is used ninety one times in this book (in the NASB). God defines what is clean and what is unclean as well as how one passes from clean to unclean and visa-versa.\nThe Need for and Means of Atonement. In the NASB Bible, the word \"atonement\" is used eighty times in the Old Testament. Forty nine of those uses occur in the book of Leviticus. Atonement, in the Biblical sense, can be defined as:\n\nA reparation of the relationship between God and man through the life of a sacrifice.\n\nThe emphasis on the word \"atonement\" in Leviticus reminds us of the need for atonement between a Holy God and a sinful Israel. The sacrificial system laid out in Leviticus provides the means of atonement by taking the life of a sacrifice (see Leviticus 17:11).\n\n\nOutline\n0. Instructions for Sacrifices [1 - 7]\nI.

Based on the knowledge of Susa and Persian customs and the emphasis/explanation of the Jewish festival of Purim, it is likely that the author was a Jew who was living or had lived in Persia.\nDate and Context\nThere are a couple important dates that frame the dating of the book of Esther.  First, the reign of Xerxes, most likely the king described in Esther, ended in 465 BC.  Second, the Persian empire would finally succumb to the Greeks in 331 BC.  Clearly, Esther must have been written after 465 BC as Xerxes is a part of the story and there are no hints of Greek influence in the book which hints that the book was written sometime at least between 465 and 331 BC.  Based on Esther 9:9, it is likely that the festival of Purim had been going on for some time when this book was written, so I believe it is likely that the book of Esther was written sometime between 465 and 400 BC.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Sovereignty of God.  One of the most ironic aspects of the book of Esther is that it never onces mentions God and yet one of the principle themes is the sovereignty of God.  This is evidenced by the numerous 'coincidences', rolls of the dice, and ironic twists in the story.  Haman, enemy of God's chosen people, is thwarted, no thanks to the drunken king Xerxes, and ends up being killed on the very apparatus he created for Mordecai.  The fact that God is never mentioned is actually meant to encourage the reader him/herself to look 'behind' the circumstances and notice that there is more going on than meets the eye.  The festival of Purim itself is an acknowledgment that chance and probability, both of which demonstrate our lack of sovereignty as humans, are controlled and used by God to bring about His plans.\n\nOutline\n0.

What is even more interesting is that one of the principle themes of this book is the sovereignty of God.  This theme is primarily communicated through the use of irony and 'chance' in the story.\n\nThe book of Esther is a Chiasm.  A chiasm, also called a chiasmus or chiastic structure, is a common literary device throughout the Bible where the first and last sections of a passage are similar/balanced, the second and second-to-last sections are similar/balanced, the third and third-to-last sections are similar/balanced, and on and on leading to a central, focal point in the passage.  This gives the narrative a balance, provides artistic unity to a work, and focuses the readers attention to the focal point.  The focal point of Esther is when Haman is humiliated by having to lead Mordecai around on a donkey.  The point of this dramatic reversal is that it could only happen if there was something other than 'chance' at work.  In the book of Esther, the chiasm also serves to accentuate the structure and balance of the events which is yet another way to highlight the fact that God is at work in the events described in the book.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/wisdom_literature/":{"url":"old_testament/wisdom_literature/","title":"Wisdom Literature","keywords":"","body":"Wisdom Literature\n(Job, Book of Psalms, Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon)\n"},"old_testament/wisdom_literature/job.html":{"url":"old_testament/wisdom_literature/job.html","title":"Job","keywords":"","body":"Job\nAuthorship and Audience\nThe authorship of Job is highly debated. Some claim Job was the author, others Elihu, others say it must have been some by-stander. Ultimately, we really do not know as we have no explicit statement from the text and no conclusive evidence from history. In my opinion, there are a few points that make Elihu the most likely author. First, I do not believe the author was Job. If Job wrote the book after the events took place, this would mean that he would have been given revelation into the courtroom scenes in Job one and two. This would give him insight into the cause of his suffering which, while still not vindicating God's rightness in the matter, would have at least helped him understand the background to his suffering. For poetic reasons, I believe that he never got this understanding and never had the full story revealed to him in his lifetime. The second argument for Elihu as the author is that Elihu is the only one who interacts in the story who is not rebuked by God or Job (unlike Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job's wife). It appears that Elihu is right in most of what he has to say and, thus, would be a good candidate for recording the exchange.\nNo audience is explicitly given in the book of Job and any views on the audience of this book are closely tied to one's view of when the book was written. As I believe the book was likely written during the time of the Patriarchs, this book may have been shared with the patriarchs themselves or the early nation of Israel. This is largely based on the fact that Elihu is called a \"Buzite\" (Job 32:6) and Buz is mentioned in Genesis 22:20-21 as one of Abraham's nephews. As mentioned, the audience is largely dictated by the date when the book was written and that is a matter of significant debate.\nDate and Context\nOne of the interesting things about the book of Job is that it is the book that probably has the widest possible date range suggested by scholars. Some suggest it was written as late as the post-exilic period (between 499 - 400 B.C. after Israel had returned from the exile) while others propose it was written as early as the times of the Patriarchs (the times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob described in Genesis). I argue that the events recorded in the book of Job likely occurred in the time of that Patriarchs and that the book was written no later than the time of Moses and probably during the time of the Patriarchs. This argument is supported by the claim that Job lived 140 years after the events described in the book of Job (see Job 42:16), the language used throughout the book is similar to the language used in the book of Genesis (for example, the use of the word \"Eloah\" and \"El\" for God), and Job's role as a 'priestly' intercessor in Job 42:7-10 is similar to that of Abraham in Genesis 20:17. If this early dating of the book is true, this makes Job the first, written revelation from God that we still have today. In that sense, Job becomes an introduction to the Bible, a role its themes fulfill very well.\nTheological Theme(s)\n\nThe Rightness of God. What I would argue to be the primary theme of the book deals with the question: \"Is God right?\". That is: \"Is God right (or synonymously: just) in allowing the trials to come upon Job?\". Once the dialog between Job and his friends begins, this is the central question that drives most of their discussion. Job's friends attempt to defend and prove the rightness of God by saying that God always punishes evil in this life and always blesses good in this life. Job, who posed the initial questions about the rightness of God in 3:20-26, does not buy into this theory and dismantles their arguments. This makes the book of Job interesting as the bulk of the book is spent seeking an answer to Job's questions rather than actually providing an answer. Towards the end, the responses from Elihu and God establish God's authority, power, and right to do that which He pleases. Even still, Job is never told exactly why he suffered and we never learn how God's rightness and justice related to Job's suffering. We learn God is wise and right, but many of the details and implications of this remain a mystery in this book.\nGod is the Source of Wisdom. Throughout the various dialogs and responses in this book (which make up chapters 3 - 42:6), the fundamental question is: 'How do you know?'. When Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar attempt to defend God's actions, we ought to be asking ourselves how they know the position they are defending to be true. For example, in Job 4:7 Eliphaz opens with the rhetorical questions: \"who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?\". This statement is one of many that summarizes the position of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. The immediate question ought to be: \"How do you know this is true?\" (hint: Eliphaz gives us some details when he begins the next verse with \"According to what I have seen...\"). The book of Job is not just about what is being said, but also on what grounds it is being said; that is, epistemology is central to the book of Job. How can man know what God is doing? How can man know if God is right? When it comes to questions of who God is and what he is doing/will do, we inherently have very little insight and need knowledge from something outside of ourselves. This is the basis of divine revelation as an epistemology. We cannot observe or discern what God is like, so He reveals Himself to us that we might know Him. As Job notes in Job 28, God as the source of all wisdom and, thus, the source from which our understanding must be derived. The book of Job establishes and, to some extent, introduces the importance of revelation from God.\n\nOutline\n0. Prologue  [1 - 2]\n\nA. Background on Job  [1:1-5]\nB.

In reality, the focus is not on the suffering itself, but on the questions that come with suffering (viz \"Why?\" and \"How could God let this happen to me?\").\nWhen reading Job, keep in mind that many of the questions brought up throughout the book are not answered (at least not directly in the book of Job). For example, Job never learns why he suffered. We never hear a robust explanation of why a Just God can let the wicked prosper, even for a short time. As I mentioned in the \"Date and Context\" section, if the book of Job is one of the earliest, recorded revelations from God, it has an introductory role in laying the groundwork for what will be answered later in the Bible. Does Job ever get the mediator he asks for in Job 9:30-35? Does Job ever get the resurrection he asks wants so badly in 14:13-17?\nNotice how advanced the mining technology of Job's time was as described in Job 28:1-11. There appears to be some form of dynamite (28:9), scaffolding/rigging (28:4), and an accurate understanding of geology (28:5).\n\nFootnotes\n* Note: There is a detailed summary of the dialog between Job and his friends here.\n** Note: TRP stands for the \"Temporal Response Principle\" which encapsulates the fundamental argument presented by Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. This principle states that God will (and even must) respond with punishment in this world for those who do evil. It also includes the converse: that God will respond with blessings in this world for those who do good.\n"},"old_testament/wisdom_literature/job_summary.html":{"url":"old_testament/wisdom_literature/job_summary.html","title":"Summary of Dialog in Job","keywords":"","body":"Summary of the Dialog in the Book of Job\nTRP = \"Temporal Response Principle\" = The principle that God will respond to those who sin and do evil with punishment in this life and He will respond to those who obey Him and do good with reward and blessings in this life. This is a highly simplified version of the argument Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar present in their argument with Job.\nAll references are to the book of Job unless otherwise noted\n\n\n\n\nEliphaz\nBildad\nZophar\n\n\n\n\n1st Conversation\nChapters 4 – 5 The TRP is true based on supernatural revelation (4). As clearly demonstrated throughout history, man’s nature is for trouble (5:1-7) and Job should repent (5:17-27).\nChapter 8 TRP is explained (8:3-4) and supported using natural examples reasoning inductively: effect to cause. If you are being punished, you must have sinned (as necessitated by the TRP) (8:20).\nChapter 11 God is way more complex than even Job realized (11:7) and repentance is the TRP’s means to get favor from God (11:13-20).\n\n\nJob's Rebuttal\nChapters 6 – 7 [talking to Eliphaz] Job emotionally (6:1-7) wishes for death (6:8-13) as his friends are not helping but are just scared and have not pointed out any specific sin in Job (6:14-30).  [talking to God] Job questions God’s compassion by pointing the frailty of man (7:1-10) and the bothersome meddling of God (7:11-21). If Job really has sinned, he wishes that God would just pass over his sin (7:20-21).\nChapters 9 – 10 God is way more complicated than Bildad claimed as seen in creation and isn’t governed by cause and effect (9:4-10), the wicked and righteous are ultimately treated the same way and there is no way for Job to find or talk with God, so he wishes for a mediator (9:30-35). With God’s goodness in question (10:3), Job points out that the TRP makes God look maniacal (10:8-18).\nChapters 12 – 14 Job is smart enough to understand the TRP and has an appreciation of the complexity of God (12:1-12), yet he gives many examples of ‘world-view failures’ with the TRP (12:17-25). Job’s friends are accused of twisting the truth to try to defend God (13:6-12) and Job pleads that God would not see him as an enemy and that God would be shown to be good (13:20-28) because man is finite and death if final (14:1-12)...unless God could resurrect man and then we could know that God cares (Job wishes for this) (14:13-17).\n\n\n2nd Conversation\nChapter 15 Job has no wisdom because his lips have shown him to be guilty (15:1-6) and he is no smarter than us (15:7-10). History has shown that the TRP is true and has shown the traits and symptoms of the guilty man (15:17-35), which Job is demonstrating.\nChapter 18 The world is a closed, deterministic system with internal mechanisms that force an outcome (18:5) which means that Job is not an exception (18:4). One such outcome is that things can backfire and the trap that the wicked lays will come back to ensnare him (18:5-10) which will cause him to follow a chain reaction that will lead to death (18:11-21).\nChapter 20 It is ancient wisdom and a well known fact that the wicked man is punished in this life (20:4-5) and follows a life cycle (20:6-11) in which God punishes him and causes his wealth to become a poison that destroys him (20:12-29).\n\n\nJob's Rebuttal\nChapters 16 – 17 [talking to Eliphaz] Job points out that his friends are the ones with the problem in this situation because they are just scared (16:1-5). God is the one that has made Job look guilty (16:6-17) so Job wishes for a day in court and an advocate (16:18-22). [talking to God] Job claims that God is the one who framed him (17:1-5) and makes him look hated before men (17:6-10) so that there is no hope for Job because no one realizes that Job has been framed (17:11-16).\nChapter 19 The one who is trapping Job is God (19:6) which implies that the system is not as closed as Bildad had argued because God is intervening and is active in this ‘closed’ system. In fact, God is working and has done many things that do not fit Bildad’s theory of a closed system without exceptions (19:7-22). This is why Job wishes that God would make him a new system in which his words would be recorded and not forgotten and that Job would get a chance to see God after death (19:23-29).\nChapter 21 Job addresses Zophar’s idealistic claims by pointing out that the wicked “live, continue on, also become very powerful” (Job 21:7). The wicked do not suffer the fate Zophar described, but instead become prosperous (Job 21:8-16). Given that the wicked prosper, does God judge the wicked or their children (Job 21:17-21)? Even though Job can identify what appears to be a problem, he can’t teach God anything (Job 21:22). Also, death is final for both the evil and the good which means there appears to be no justice (Job 21:23-34). This means the TRP is wrong.\n\n\n3rd Conversation\nChapter 22 Job is punished and is therefore guilty (22:4-5). The list of his sins is long (22:6-20) and the results are terrible (22:10-11). Repentance of sin is the only way to solve the problem (22:21-30). In fact, once restored, Job might even become the mediator he desired for someone else who is suffering (22:29-30).\nChapter 25 Job does not understand that God is so holy (25:1-3) that righteousness before Him is unattainable (25:4). Compared to God, even the moon and stars are nothing (25:5) so how can man think himself anything (25:6)?\nN/A\n\n\nJob's Rebuttal\nChapters 23 – 24 In order to get an answer, Job wishes that he could find God Himself, who would be personal and compassionate enough to listen and answer Job and yet just and righteous enough to support Job and settle his case (23:1-7). The problem is, Job does not see or know where God is (23:8-9) but God knows all of Job’s ways (23:10-14) so Job can’t talk to God (23:15-17). The question is, where will God’s power come into play? Will God’s power side with His compassion or with His justice, or both? Job questions God’s justice because there are many injustices (24:1-17) for which Job, sarcastically, is glad the wicked are punished (24:18-25).\nChapter 26 Job points out that his friends are no help and asks how, or from what source, Bildad got his information (26:1-4). He goes on to point out that God is much higher and more mysterious than Bildad realizes and that God has amazing power to bring things about in creation that man cannot even fathom (26:5-14).\nN/A\n\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/","title":"Prophets","keywords":"","body":"Prophets\n(Isaiah - Malachi)\n"},"old_testament/prophets/ezekiel.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/ezekiel.html","title":"Ezekiel","keywords":"","body":"Ezekiel ~ “God is Strong”\nAuthorship and Audience\nThe first four verses of the book indicate that Ezekiel is the author. Ezekiel was a Levite who would normally have become a priest at age 30 (this is likely what the first verse of the book is referring to). He was likely taken from Judah to Babylon in the second wave of exiles between 605 and 595 BC.\nDate and Context\nEzekiel started prophesying in 592 B.C. and kept prophesying for twenty to twenty two years (until around 570 B.C.). Many Israelites have been taken into exile at this point and are wondering about the promises of God. Is God still faithful to His promises (Abrahamic and Davidic Covenants, for example)? Does God lack the power to perform and execute His will and promises?\nTheme(s)\n\nPresence/Glory of God. The temple features prominently in the book of Ezekiel. God's presence leaves the temple in Ezekiel ten, chapters forty through forty eight describe the new temple, and God's presence returns to the new temple in Ezekiel forty three. In the Old Testament, the temple served as a connection, so to speak, between Israel (along with the nations) and Yahweh (for more on this, read Solomon's dedication of the Temple in 1 Kings 8). If God removes His presence from the temple as in chapter 10, He is effectively severing His connection with His people. The book of Ezekiel will describe why God removes His presence from the temple, deal with the repercussions of this, and the future of God's connection with Israel and the nations.\n\nNature of Sin. The book of Ezekiel provides a graphic and, frankly, explicit picture of sin. Sin, as described in this book, is spiritual adultery. Chapter sixteen spares no detail as it describes the adultery Israel has committed against Yahweh. In this passage, Israel is described as a \"harlot\" and an \"adulteress wife\" who was pulled away to other 'gods' and religions. Ezekiel reminds us that sin, in its essence, is a rejection of God and His authority.\n\nDavidic Covenant. The Davidic Covenant (see 2 Samuel 7) promises that David’s seed will build a house for God and God will establish his throne (2 Samuel 7:13). The book of Ezekiel, written at a time when many would have doubted the power and faithfulness of God, begins with a reminder of God’s sovereign rule over the nations and closes with a picture of the future temple. The exile seems to eclipse even the possibility of the Davidic Covenant being fulfilled, but Ezekiel reminds his readers that God is still ruling and will fulfill the covenant He promised to David. In fact, the rule of the Davidic King is explicitly mentioned in Ezekiel 37:24-28.\n\n\nOutline\n0. Ezekiel's Vision and Call to Prophecy  [1 - 3]\n\nChariot-throne (ch. 1)\n\nI.

The intended audience is not given directly in the book but it can be surmised by the fact that Daniel 2:4 - 7 is written with Aramaic, the common language of the Ancient Near East at the time Daniel was writing. Thus, it seems that Daniel, at least the first half of the book, is intended for an international audience.\nDate and Context\nDaniel and his friends were likely taken in the first conquest of Jerusalem that occurred in 605 B.C. (Dan. 1:1-7 and 6:28). The events (not necessarily the events described in the visions) in the book took place between 605 and 530 B.C. and the bulk of the book was likely finished by 535 BC. This meant that Daniel was involved in both the Babylonian and Persian governments. In the midst of exile, Israel must have had a lot of questions... Is God powerful? Is God sovereign? Is God faithful? What about all of God's promises? Although indirectly, the book of Daniel answers these questions and gives hope to God's exiled people.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod is sovereign over ALL nations at ALL times. The book of Daniel highlights God's sovereign control over kingdoms, kings, and history itself (see Daniel 2:21a).\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1]\nI.

The Future as it Relates to God's People (see 10:14)  [10 - 12]\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nFrom a literary perspective, the book of Daniel is masterfully written. One of the most prominent evidences of this is found in Daniel 2. In Daniel 2, we find that the king has had a dream for which he would like an interpretation. To prove the legitimacy of his diviners and wise-men, he asks them to interpret the dream, but refuses to tell them his dream so that anyone who wishes to provide an interpretation must first divine the dream itself. This is an impossible task and, to make matters worse, the king soon orders that all who were asked for an interpretation of the unknown dream be killed. As the commander of the king's bodyguard was on his way to kill the wise-men, however, Daniel pleads with the king for more time, requests an answer from God, and receives revelation of the mystery (2:19). At this point in the narrative, I believe the most natural question is: What is was the king's dream and what is its interpretation? This is not, however, Daniel's primary point. The primary point is not the revelation (that is, the content of the revelation), but the revealer (the source of the revelation). Notice that the dream is revealed to Daniel in 2:19, but we do not get to hear what the dream was about until 2:31. It is more important that we first hear Daniel's prayer, which spotlights God's sovereignty, wisdom, and knowledge and then hear Daniel's preface before the king, which underscores the fact that God is the source of this revelation and God's wisdom far surpasses any human wisdom.\n\nDaniel 2:4 - 7 are written in Aramaic. At the time Daniel was written, Aramaic was the lingua franca that would have been spoken and understood by many in the Ancient Near East. This highlights the fact that the events discussed are of international importance and should get international attention.\n\nDaniel's vision encompass history from the current events of Daniel's day to the inter-testamental period to eschatology which has yet to happen.\n\nIn Daniel 12:2, we see one of the clearest descriptions in the Old Testament of the resurrection for either judgement or condemnation.\n\nChapters two through seven have a chiastic structure. To illustrate this, the chapters could be displayed as follows with chapters two and seven paired, chapters three and six paired, and four and five paired:\n\nCh. 2 - King Nebuchadnezzar's Dream: 4 Kingdoms\n\nCh. 3 - Daniel's Friends are Persecuted\n\nCh. 4 - God Humbles King Nebuchadnezzar\nCh. 5 - God Humbles Belshazzar\n\nCh. 6 - Daniel is Persecuted\n\nCh. 7 - Daniel's Vision: 4 Kingdoms\n\n\nWhen reading about the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar sets up in chapter three, don't forget the vision that Daniel just saw (the statue of a man made of four, different materials). By making the statue completely of gold, Nebuchadnezzar is declaring that his kingdom will last forever and the dream he had, which God revealed and explained through Daniel, will not come to pass.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/hosea.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/hosea.html","title":"Hosea","keywords":"","body":"Hosea ~ “Salvation”\nAuthorship and Audience\nLikely written by Hosea (see 1:1).

This would have taken place around the early 900s BC.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod’s Love in Judgement. One of the principal, theological themes of Hosea is God’s love in judgement. This is demonstrated by Hosea himself in marrying a prostitute and calling Israel to repent and return throughout the book (see the outline below). Put another way, this book answers the question: “If God loves us, how can he judge us?”. We will see that God has used and will use judgement as a way to bring His people back to Himself.\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1:1]\nI. Hosea as an Example of God’s Love  [1:2 - 3]\nII.

We know very little about Joel as there is very little mentioned in this book and there is no character in the Bible that fits Joel's profile.\nDate and Context\nAs there is very little historical context given in the book itself, one of the biggest clues used to estimate the date of Joel is the lack of any reference to an established king (both in the beginning of the book and in the judgements throughout). Given this clue, the majority of commentators today will date the book sometime shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem in 587/6 BC.\nPersonally, however, I argue that the book was more likely written sometime during the 9th century B.C. (probably around 830 B.C.). I argue this for three reasons:\n\nThe ‘reign’ of Athaliah and subsequent reign of Joash who started ruling at age 7 (2 Kings 11-12, 2 Chronicles 23-24) would have been a time in which the king would have been weak/not a prominent figure.\n(The weakest argument) The similarities between Joel and the book of Obadiah (Joel 2:32 w/ Obadiah 17 and Joel 3:3 w/ Obadiah 11) suggest that Joel was written earlier rather than later.\nWhy would Joel use locusts as an example of judgement if Jerusalem had just been destroyed and the people had been sent into exile?\n\nTheme(s)\n\nTheology of Judgement. Joel presents us with a theology of judgement, principally identifying two aspects of judgement. First, while some judgements occur/have occurred in a localized and limited sense, there will be a day (the Day of Yahweh/the LORD) of final and ultimate judgement. The proper response in light all judgement from God is repentance. Secondly, we see the two 'sides' of judgement. For those opposed to God, judgement represents the dispensing of His righteous wrath, yet for those who have submitted to God’s rule and authority, judgement justly poured out on those who hate God and His people is a welcome deliverance and salvation.\n\nOutline\n0.

The Day of Yahweh  [2:1-11]\n\nII. Repentance  [2:12 - 2:17]\n\nThis is Israel moving from the curses in section I to the blessings in section III.\n\nIII. Restoration (Blessings) [2:18 - 3]\n\nA. Physical Restoration  [2:18-27]\nB. Spiritual Restoration  [2:28-32]\nC. National Restoration (and Judgement)  [3]\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nThe reference to locusts is not just about locusts. As described in Deuteronomy 28:38-42, locusts destroy crops which means no food and no offerings (see: Joel 2:13-14, Psalm 50, Hosea 9:4).\nOur understanding of the “Day of Yahweh/the LORD”, which was introduced with this name by Obadiah, is greatly expanded by the book of Joel. In Acts 2:17-21, the Apostle Peter uses Joel as the basis for his argument that the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost is a sign that we are entering the latter days. In other words, the process given in Joel (Spirit > prophecy/visions > wonders > Day of Yahweh) has begun (the first domino has fallen). Understanding Joel gives Peter's argument more force:  'In light of the coming judgement that Joel has talked about, repent and call upon the name of Yahweh.' (major paraphrase).\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/amos.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/amos.html","title":"Amos","keywords":"","body":"Amos ~ “Burden Bearer”\nAuthorship\nLikely Amos (see 1:1).

This would date the book to around 760 - 750 BC. In this time, Israel was enjoying tremendous prosperity and wealth as is alluded to in the book of Amos (references to summer houses and ivory in 3:15 and 6:4).\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Justice of God's Judgements.

These help communicate an idea through repetition and offer a way for listeners/readers to mentally structure the content. In chapter one, the phrase \"For three transgressions... and for four...\" is used to begin each of the judgements on the seven nations. In chapter three, the word \"citadel\" or \"strongholds\" is repeated. In chapter four, the phrase \"'Yet you have not returned to Me', declares Yahweh.\" is repeated. In chapter five, Israel is repeatedly encouraged to \"seek\". The visions of chapter seven and eight are each introduced with the refrain \"Thus the Lord, Yahweh showed me and behold\".\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/obadiah.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/obadiah.html","title":"Obadiah","keywords":"","body":"Obadiah ~ “Servant of Yahweh”\nAuthorship\nLikely Obadiah (vs. 1). Depending on the date of the writing, this may be the same prophet mentioned in 1 Kings 18:1-16.\nDate and Context\nDue to the lack of biographical references, the primary clues as to the date when Obadiah was written come from the events described in the book. There are two primary dates that would fit the invasion of Jerusalem as described in the later part of verse 11.\n\nThe first would be around 853 - 841 B.C. when the Arabs and Philistines invaded Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 8:20-22; 2 Chronicles 21:8-20). This would mean that the author of this book would likely be the same prophet mentioned in 1 Kings 18:1-16 as a contemporary of Elijah.\n\nThe second date would be the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C. at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (see Lamentations, Jeremiah 52). This is the most popular view among scholars today. Many scholars who support this view cite the similarities between Obadiah and Jeremiah 49:1-22 as evidence. \n\n\nTheme(s)\n\nGod’s Faithfulness in Judgement. With Esau/Edom’s rebellion and violence toward Israel, a key question is whether or not God is faithful to His promises to Jacob/Israel and Esau/Edom. Is God faithful? Is He powerful enough to be faithful? This book makes it clear that God’s faithfulness and power are both demonstrated through His judgement. Those who oppose God will not have the final say.\n\nOutline\nI. God’s Coming Judgement Against Esau/Edom  [1:1-9]\n\nGod proclaims the extent and completeness of His judgement against Esau/Edom.\n\nII. Esau/Edom’s Actions in Israel’s Day of Distress  [1:10-14]\n\nGod describes the violence done by Esau/Edom to Jacob/Israel and retroactively pleas with Esau/Edom not to do what they have already done. \n\nIII. God’s Actions in The Nations’ Day of Distress (the Day Of Yahweh)  [1:15-21]\n\nEsau/Edom’s actions in the day of Israel’s distress will be repaid by God in the day of distress brought upon all nations.\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nEsau/Edom’s rebellion is rebellion against God (see Gen. 25:23 and  2 Chron. 21). That is, the very faithfulness of God is challenged by Esau/Edom’s rebellion.\n\nThe first verse is interesting: “the Vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning Edom” (emphases added).\n\nIf Obadiah was written at the earlier of the possible dates (853 - 841 B.C.), this would mean that Obadiah was (one of) the earliest of the minor prophets to write. This is significant because he introduces the concept of the \"Day of Yahweh/the LORD\" which is a central theme for many of the prophets.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/jonah.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/jonah.html","title":"Jonah","keywords":"","body":"Jonah ~ “Dove”\nAuthorship and Audience\nBased on some of the specific details known by the author (e.g. ch. 2), I believe it is possible and probable that Jonah himself is the author of this book. We know from 2 Kings 14:25 that Jonah had at least one other prophecy foretelling the expansion of Israel's borders. If Jonah himself did write this book, it may have been written retrospectively after Jonah started to better submit to what God was trying to do with the gentiles.\nDate and Context\nBased on 2 Kings 14:25, we know that Jonah's life had at least some overlap with that of Jeroboam II's reign from 793 to 753 BC. As Jonah had prophesied, Israel (the Northern Kingdom) had expanded her borders and was enjoying what would be one of the more prosperous times in her history. Nineveh would later fall in 612 BC (see Nahum).\nTheme(s)\n\nGod's Righteousness and Inevitable Judgement.  This book begins with a command given to Jonah that he go to Nineveh and announce the judgement God was planning to pour out on the city. From this, we see that God is righteous and cannot stand evil. Also, we see another instance of the recurring pattern that disobedience and rebellion against God demands judgement.\nGod's Mercy and Compassion.  In this book, we see that God is immensely merciful and compassionate. He relents of the judgement He had planned to bring against Nineveh (4:11), sends a fish to save Jonah (1:17), and calms the sea for the sailors (1:15). God is so characterized by mercy and compassion (see Exodus 34:6) that Jonah cites this as the reason he fled from God's command in the first place (4:2). He was sure God would end up being compassionate and relent concerning calamity (for some, unwritten reason, he didn't want this to occur).\nGod's Patience.  The book of Jonah also reminds us of God's tremendous patience. God is patient with Jonah even in his rank disobedience (ch. 1). He is patient with the Ninevites in sending Jonah to them to warn them of the coming judgement forty days before it occurs rather than punishing them outright (3). God is patient in the foolishness of Jonah after God choose to show mercy and compassion on Nineveh by not sending judgement (4). If the Bible is true in describing every sin as a personal offense against God, then God has displayed patience which ought to bring us to our knees in worship!\nYHWH is the God of Gentiles as well as Jews.  It is fascinating that Jonah's initial mission is to gentiles (the Ninevites) and, even in his disobedience, more gentiles (the sailors) come to trust in YHWH. It is clear from this book that God is not a God who is only concerned with Israel and the Jewish people, but also with the whole world including gentiles. All of the attributes of God described above (righteousness, mercy, compassion, and patience) are all demonstrated to gentiles in this book. In fact, this book goes so far as to make the one Jewish follower of YHWH, Jonah, seem unfaithful and stubborn relative to the gentiles with whom he comes in contact. In many ways, the gentiles in this story are foils for Jonah (and it is the gentiles, not Jonah, who display a right attitude toward God).\n\nOutline\n0. Jonah Flees the Presence of YHWH  [1:1-16]\nI. Jonah in the Fish  [1:17 - 2:10]\nII. Jonah in Nineveh  [3:1-9]\nIII. God's Mercy and Jonah's Anger  [3:10 - 4:11]\nObservations/Notes\n\nI believe that many (I dare say 'most') Christians have a wrong view of this book. From their perspective, a simple outline of the events in this book would be something like: \nFirst, Jonah disobeys God's command to go to Nineveh by sailing for Tarshish (ch. 1). Jonah is then thrown overboard during the storm and swallowed by a \"great fish\" (1:17). Jonah repents (ch. 2) and goes to Nineveh where he does what God had originally asked him to do (ch. 3). After all of this, Jonah slips back into his former attitude (from ch. 1) where he wishes that God had not show His mercy and compassion to the Ninevites (ch. 4).\nThis outline, however, is not accurate. The primary problem is that it misunderstands Jonah's prayer in Jonah 2. Not every prayer, even one recorded in the Bible, is necessarily good or completely sound from a theological perspective. In this case, it is easy to view this prayer as one of repentance when, in reality, Jonah never repents. In fact, while he does thank God for His deliverance, he overemphasizes his own role in his salvation (see verses 2:4 and 2:7). Jonah does not seem to understand what the sailors said in 1:14: \"... for You, oh YHWH, have done as it pleased you\".\nMost of what Jonah does and says in this book is wrong and, in many ways, unrepentant Jonah is a foil for the repentant gentiles he meets throughout this story. It is the gentiles who are exemplary in responding to God in this book and not Jonah.\n\nJonah contains what is one of the most fantastic stories in the whole Bible: Jonah getting swallowed by a \"great fish\" (1:17). There has been much ink spilled on this subject already and I have nothing to contribute to the discussion more than to say that if God created the universe, He can certainly control a fish and supernaturally preserve the life of anyone He wills inside or outside of a fish. I caution the reader to not get too caught up in the details of the fish as this is not the focus presented in the text. The focus is that God can save whom He wills, when He wills, how He wills, and for reasons He knows and wills.\nIt is interesting to note that when Jonah flees, he is fleeing \"from the presence of YHWH\" (see 1:3 and 1:10).\nBecause the book is so short and we are not given a lot of historical and contextual background in the book itself, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the revival described in 3:5-9 is one of the greatest described in the entire Bible (probably second only to the future, Jewish revival described in Revelation 7:4-8). It appears that the vast majority of the population of Nineveh (around 120,000 young children according to 4:11), humbled themselves and repented (3:10). What a wonderful image! And, what a stark contrast between the gentiles, who quickly humble themselves and repent, and Jonah, who never repents.\nThis books is interesting as there are many unwritten events and sentiments going on throughout the book. For a few examples: \n\nIt is interesting that we know nothing of the nature or substance of the Ninevites' disobedience to God.\nJonah hates Ninevites, based on 4:2, and wants them to face judgement for what they have done, but we aren't told exactly why this is the case.\nThe discussion between Jonah and the sailors in chapter one (1:8-10) is strange in that we only gets bits and pieces of their interchange and even that appears to be jumbled and possibly not in chronological order (specifically 1:10).\nJonah's proclamation to Nineveh (3:10) is recorded as nothing more than a sentence fragment. We are not sure if there was more to his message than this and if this was an appropriate communication of the message God had told him to preach (see 3:2).\n\nSome of these characteristics make it hard to fill in some of the exact details of Jonah's story, but it is important to recognize that the author is telling us and focusing our attention on that which his audience needed to know. In this book, it appears that the primary purpose is not to focus on anything Jonah did, but to highlight God's work even among the gentiles.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/micah.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/micah.html","title":"Micah","keywords":"","body":"Micah ~ “Who is like Yahweh?”\nAuthorship\nAlmost certainly Micah of Moresheth (1:1 and 3:1-4). We do not know where Moresheth is today, but Jeremiah 26:18 affirms that Micah was from Moresheth. In fact, Jeremiah 26:16-19 includes a quote from Micah 3:12 used to defend what Jeremiah himself is prophesying.\nDate and Context\nMicah prophesied around the same time as Isaiah (compare Micah 1:1 to Isaiah 1:1). Micah's ministry likely began sometime around 740 B.C., shortly after Isaiah's ministry had begun, and ended around 700 BC. Unlike Isaiah, however, Micah's vision is not only about Jerusalem and the Southern kingdom, but it also has to do with Samaria and the Northern Kingdom. This, combined with the dates of Micah's ministry, is particularly interesting because this means that Israel, the Northern Kingdom, would have been exiled about half way through Micah's ministry (the Northern Kingdom was exiled in 722 B.C.).\nTheme(s)\n\nGod's Judgement in His Covenant Plan. The book of Micah explains why God will judge His people, but also lays out God's redemptive and restorative plans for His people. In the process, we get a picture of how God uses judgement both to refine His people and to punish those who oppose Him. The final chapter of this book is a great statement of hope and trust in God's ability to enact His covenant plan.\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1:1]\nI.

We do not have any other biographical information about Nahum other than the fact that he was an Elkoshite (born in Elkosh).\nDate and Context\nWhile we do not know the exact date that this book was written, we do have two events that give us a relatively small window in which the book must have been written. First, Nahum 3:8 refers to \"No-amon\", the Egyptian city of Amon/Thebes, as already fallen. Amon/Thebes did not fall until 663 B.C. which means that Nahum must have been written after 663 BC. Second, given that the prophecy of this book centers around the destruction of Nineveh, the book must have been written before the city was destroyed by the Babylonians and Medes in 612 BC. Thus, Nahum was likely written sometime between 663 and 612 BC.\nFor those who accept that Nahum was written between 663 and 612 B.C., there is much debate as to the exact date of this prophecy. Some scholars have suggested that Nahum may be one of the \"seers\" who spoke to King Manasseh upon his return from Assyria (see 2 Chronicles 33:1-18 (vs. 18 in particular)). This would put the writing of Nahum around 650 BC.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod's Unstoppable Judgement. In the book of Nahum, the judgement of God is tied into God's attributes. Because of this, we see that God's judgements are inevitable and unstoppable. There is nothing man can do to stop God's decrees.\n\nThe Two Sides of Judgement. Like a coin, judgement has two sides to it. For those opposed to God, His judgement is a terrible thing to be feared. For those who fear and obey God, however, judgement brings peace and even comfort. Throughout the book of Nahum, we see this contrast reiterated over and over. Nahum 1:1 - 2:2 is a specific section where this theme is abundantly clear.\n\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1:1]\nI. God's Inevitable Judgement and Its Consequences  [1:2 - 2:2]\n\nA.

The futility of trusting in man  [3:15b-19]\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nThe phrase that God is \"slow to anger\" in Nahum 1:3 seems out of place given the verses around it talk of God's power, wrathfulness, and jealousy. Think back to the book of Jonah, however. Consider the fact that Jonah was likely written at least a century earlier. God had been patient and gracious with the Ninevites in sending Jonah to them and was patient in the time that passed between Jonah and Nahum. Given that judgement for rebellion against a holy God is justly and swiftly deserved, the fact that anyone in human history has awoken to live another day is a testimony to God's patience.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of the fall of Nineveh as described by the book of Nahum is that it involves both a flood/water (see Nahum 1:8 and 2:6) and fire (see Nahum 3:13 and 3:15). Burning a captured city is a common action in the Ancient Near East, but the role of the water/flood in the siege is the topic of much debate. Greek accounts of the tradition they received about this event (recorded around 600 years after 612 B.C.) do mention that a flood made the capture of the city possible. The Babylonian accounts, however, do not mention any such flooding (see NAHUM AND THE GREEK TRADITION ON NINEVEH’S FALL). I do not believe that the silence of the Babylonian accounts removes the possibility of a flood making the capture of the city possible. Babylonian records are not known for their candor and it is very possible that a flood, if one occurred, would not be mentioned in the record of Nineveh's capture. Some have also argued that Nahum's references to a flood are purely metaphorical (see NAHUM AND THE GREEK TRADITION ON NINEVEH’S FALL) in that they are not referring to a literal flood. I believe that the language used in Nahum 2:6, however, lends itself to an understanding that Nahum is referring to a real flood that will come upon the city.\n\nNahum's name means “comfort” or “consolation”. This seems like an ironic name for a prophet whose primary ministry, as far as we know, was to proclaim the judgement and fall of Nineveh. It is important to remember, however, that the judgement of God has two sides. Judgement is terrible for those who are God's enemies, but it brings peace and liberation for God's people, those who love and fear Him. One of the clearest evidences of this in Scripture is Nahum 1:1 - 2:2. In this passage, there are multiple, contrasting references that highlight both the destructive nature of God's judgement and the peace and hope that it brings.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/habakkuk.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/habakkuk.html","title":"Habakkuk","keywords":"","body":"Habakkuk\nAuthorship\nLikely Habakkuk (see 1:1). Apart from his name, the meaning of which is itself the topic of debate (see the observation section below), we do not know a whole lot about Habakkuk.\nDate and Context\nWhile there are no explicit markers in the text, the rise of the Chaldeans and the promise of judgement at their hands described in Habakkuk 1:5-11 best aligns with sometime around the Battle of Carchemish (around 605 B.C.). I believe Habakkuk was likely written sometime between 609 and 605 B.C.,shortly before the Battle of Carchemish where Babylon would assert their dominance.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Totality of God's Judgement.

This is, however, the topic of much scholarly debate.\n\nHabakkuk 2:4 has immense implications for the rest of Scripture and is directly quoted in Galatians 3:11, Romans 1:17, and Hebrews 10:38. This is nothing new, however, as we have already seen this going back to Abraham in Genesis 15:6.\n\nThe reference to 'Shigionoth' is the plural form of the same word that appears in psalm 7:1. It likely describes the emotional, almost ecstatic nature of the prayer.\n\n\"The prayer of Habakkuk goeth on three's\". In the original Hebrew, the number of words in many of the phrases of Habakkuk's prayer are multiples of three.\n\nThe book of Habakkuk, as in other books like Nahum, impresses upon us the reality that God's judgement has two sides. It is just and fearful punishment for God's enemies, but is hope and salvation for God's people. This is typified in Habakkuk in 3:13 where God \"struck the head of the house of evil to lay him open from thigh to neck.\" in the process of bringing \"the salvation of Your anointed\".\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/zephaniah.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/zephaniah.html","title":"Zephaniah","keywords":"","body":"Zephaniah ~ “Yahweh Hides/Protects”\nAuthorship\nLikely Zephaniah (see 1:1). From the short genealogical background of Zephaniah given in Zephaniah 1:1, we know that Zephaniah was a descendant of King Hezekiah. This likely means that he was born into a relatively high social class.\nDate and Context\nWe know from Zephaniah 1:1 that Zephaniah's ministry took place during Josiah's reign (640 - 609 B.C.). Based on the reference to Nineveh as a city that \"dwells securely\" (Zephaniah 2:15), we can confidently say that Zephaniah's prophecy must have occurred before the fall of Nineveh 612 BC. In 627 B.C., the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal died, which severely weakened Assyria. It is possible that this prophecy occurred even before 627 while Assyria was still a very powerful nation.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Purifying Nature of God's Judgement. In the book of Zephaniah, we see that God's judgements, past, present, and future, all play a purifying role in God's salvific plan. This is most clear in Zephaniah 3:8-13 where God implores his people to \"wait\" for the day when God will \"pour out\" His indignation on the nations while at the same time giving \"to the peoples purified lips\".\n\nOutline\n0.

This was after Darius, a Persian King, had already allowed the Israelites to return to their homeland and build the temple. The work on the Temple had stalled due to opposition (see the book of Nehemiah) and Haggai comes, in part, to encourage the people to keep working.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod's Faithfulness and Future Plans. The exile was a shocking time for the Israelites. Questions about God's power, justice, love, and faithfulness abounded as the promises of God looked as though they were never going to happen. Through Haggai, God reminds the Israelites that His promises are still in play and He will one day bless His people and build a temple that will put even Solomon's spectacular temple to shame.\n\nResponding to God's Faithfulness and Future Plans. While Haggai provides some amazing promises for the future, he also proclaims to his audience some of the most direct and practical commands found in Scripture. Haggai 1:5-8 and 2:3-9 are passages that capture what was Israel's proper response to God's promises. Even though the current temple was pitiful when compared with the first temple and even though God promises to one day make a temple that will make even the first one look pitiful, the Israelites are still commanded to \"bring wood and rebuild the temple\" (1:8) and to \"take courage\" (2:4). The goal behind all of this is so that God will be glorified (see 1:8). When Israel rebuilds the temple, it glorifies God because it is a tangible reminder that God has not forgotten His promises and is still at work.\n\n\nOutline\n0.

God Promises to Bless Sinful Man  [2:10-19]\n\nJust as anything touched by an unclean person would become unclean, so it is with God's people and even all mankind. God still promises to bless His people, however, in spite of their unrighteousness.\n\nV. Zerubbabel: God's Signet Ring  [2:20-23]\n\nGod gives Zerubbabel as living proof, as it were, that His promises are still in effect (for more details on this, refer to the \"Observations/Notes\" section below).\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nAs I mentioned in one of the themes, Haggai is a very quick and direct book. The first eleven verses introduce Haggai and his message and the rest of chapter one describes the people's response to this message (1:12-15).\n\nThe name \"Zerubbabel\" is very interesting. If it is to be understood as a Hebrew name, it would translate to: \"The one sown of Babylon\". If it is Babylonian, it would translate to: \"Seed of Babylon\". Either way, there are two significant ideas that we need to pick up on. First, the reference to Babylon must take us back to the tower of Babel. Babel and Babylon are not the end and they are not the rulers. God will use one born of Babylon as a signet ring, an instrument of a king. Second, Zerubbabel's name, either explicitly or implicitly, has the concept of a seed in mind. This is significant when we think back to Genesis and God's promise that a seed of Adam would crush the head of the serpent. In effect, God is saying that the promises made throughout the entire Old Testament up to this point are not done, forgotten, or otherwise lost. They are still in play and Zerubbabel is living evidence of this. Now, read Zechariah 4:6, Luke 3:7, and Matthew 1:13.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/zechariah.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/zechariah.html","title":"Zechariah","keywords":"","body":"Zechariah ~ “Yahweh Remembers”\nAuthorship\nLikely Zechariah (see 1:1). Based on the genealogy in 1:1, we know that Zechariah was a priest descended from Iddo (who is mentioned in Nehemiah 12:4 and 16). We also know, based on the dates given in 1:1 and 1:7, that Zechariah was a contemporary of Haggai although Zechariah's ministry lasted longer than that of Haggai.\nDate and Context\nBased on passages like Zechariah 1:1, 1:7, and 7:1, we know that Zechariah started prophesying in 520 B.C., the same year as Haggai, and kept prophesying until 518 BC.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod's Word is Certain and Lasting. One of the fundamental principles underlying the visions and prophecies in the book of Zechariah is that God's word will come to pass and will stand the tests of time. It outlasts prophets, kings, and kingdoms. Even those who would ignore or reject God's word are, in fact, fulfilling it. The certainty of God's word is set as a foundation in the first six verses of Zechariah. It is easy to read over these verses and wade into the challenges of understanding the visions, but it is critical to remember that all of these prophetic visions have significance because God's Word is lasting and is certain.\n\nGod's Reign is Certain and Will Be Lasting. The book of Zechariah closes with a promise that God will one day be King \"over all the earth\" (14:9). The whole book of Zechariah, while complex at points, all leads to the point in history when God asserts His authority and takes dominion of the earth. Zechariah 9:10 notes that the same King riding on a donkey also rules \"from sea to sea\".\n\nGod's Lovingkindess is Certain and Lasting. As I mentioned in the previous point, the book of Zechariah culminates with God exercising dominion over the earth. In the process of getting to this point, we witness God's remarkable and lasting lovingkindness as He defends His people (14:3), pours out his Spirit upon \"the House of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem\" (12:10), gathers and restores His people (10:5-12), and allows nations to be called His people (2:11) (and these are just a few examples). God's lovingkindness and grace has been and will continue to be poured out on His people in all ages.\n\nProsperity for God's People is Certain and Will Be Lasting. Throughout many of the visions and the descriptions of what is to come, we are repeatedly reminded of the prosperity that will be brought to God's people. In addition to receiving salvation and being gathered back to Jerusalem by God (8:7-8), the people of God are also promised peace, crops, and the fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant (that the whole world would be blessed by Abraham's seed) (8:9-23).\n\n\nOutline\n0.

Zechariah is foundational for understanding the book of Revelation.\n\nChapters 9 - 14 are very tough to understand, or at least to outline. By way of example, consider Zechariah 9:9-10. Both verses describe the Messiah, but verse 9 has already been fulfilled by Christ (Matthew 21:5), while verse 10 has not yet been fulfilled. In two verses, Zechariah leaps from Christ's first, humble coming, to His second, triumphant return and reign.\n\n\n"},"old_testament/prophets/malachi.html":{"url":"old_testament/prophets/malachi.html","title":"Malachi","keywords":"","body":"Malachi ~ “My [God's] Messenger”\nAuthorship\nLikely Malachi (see 1:1). We do not have any other biographical details given about Malachi in the Bible which, combined with Malachi's generic name, has led some scholars to argue that Malachi is not the name of the prophet, but simply a description of a prophet as \"My [God's] messenger\". While this is possible, none of the other prophets are written anonymously and, without further evidence, I hold to the simplest explanation that Malachi is a proper name.\nDate and Context\nGiven the fact that the issues being addressed in Malachi are very similar to those addressed in Nehemiah, it is likely these two were contemporaries. It is safe to say that Malachi was written between 435 - 430 BC. According to most scholars, this makes Malachi the last book in the Old Testament Canon.\nTheme(s)\n\nGod is not Done with His People. In the book of Malachi, we find God's chosen people back in their homeland after the exile, but still sinning and rejecting God. In the book of Malachi, there are many calls to repent and return to God, but we also see that God has not given up on His people and will take action to save those who still fear Him. In this, we see God's patience, mercy, and grace clearly demonstrated.\n\nGod Must be Worshiped on His Terms. This is a theme throughout the entire Bible, but it becomes a critical point in the book of Malachi. The 'dialog' portions of Malachi make it clear that Israel was not concerned with worshiping God in the way that He designated and chose. They wanted to worship in a way that was most convenient for them. In fact, God goes so far as to say that He wishes there was someone who would \"shut the gates\" of the newly built Temple \"that you might not uselessly kindle fire on My altar!\" (1:10). God is to be worshiped on His terms, as He defines them and not according to our own agendas/convenience.\n\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1:1]\nI. Israel's Wrongs Against God  [1:2-14]\n\nA.

Matthew, also called \"Levi\" (possibly a reference to the tribe or a surname), was a tax collector (see Matthew 9:9, Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27) before becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ and later an Apostle.\nMatthew records his account of the Gospel primarily for a Jewish audience. This is evidenced by the fact that there are very few explanations of Hebrew words, customs, and places described in the Gospel. Matthew also makes more Old Testament references than any of the other Gospel accounts with 53 direct citations from 25 Old Testament books.\nDate and Context\nThe order in which the Gospels were written is highly debated. I am going to make the argument, based largely on the testimony of Eusibius in 300 A.D., that the gospel as recorded by Matthew was the first of the Gospels to be written. According to Irenaeus, Matthew wrote his book while Peter and Paul were ministering in Rome. This would place the book around 62 AD. I argue it is safe to say that Matthew was likely written between 50 and 65 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nJesus Christ is the Messiah. There are two, primary evidences that this is Matthew's primary theme. First, the content and quantity of the Old Testament passages quoted by Matthew make it clear that Matthew is interested in providing Old Testament evidence that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah). Many of the Old Testament passages which Matthew quotes make it clear that Jesus is qualified to be, and indeed is, the Messiah (see Matthew 1:23 and 2:6 as a couple examples of this). The second point of evidence that Matthew is trying to show his readers that Jesus is the Messiah is that he consistently records characters who wrestle with and answer the question: \"Who is Jesus?\" or, as the disciples put it \"What kind of a man is this...?\". Verses like: Matthew 8:27, 9:27, 9:34, 11:3, 12:8, 12:23, 14:2, 14:33, 15:27, 16:13-20, and 17:1-13 (which is not an exhaustive list) all relate to the question: \"Who is Jesus?\". Whether it is the Pharisees who say Jesus is of Satan (12:24) or Peter who confesses that Jesus is the Messiah (16:16), everyone has an opinion about Jesus. Matthew, backed by the Old Testament and supported by the testimony of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, presents the argument that Jesus is the Messiah.\n\nOutline\n0.

The Resurrection and its Implications  [28]\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nMatthew may be related to James the Less who is described as \"the son of Alphaeus\" in Matthew 10:3.\n\nQuotations from both Papias (70 - 163 A.D.) and Ireneus (130- 202 A.D.), are understood by some scholars to indicate that Matthew originally wrote his gospel account in Hebrew and that it was later translated into Greek. In fact, Foxe, in his famous work Foxe's Book of Martyrs, claims that James the Less translated Matthew's gospel account into Greek. Whether or not Matthew's Gospel account was first written in Hebrew is the subject of much scholarly debate.\n\nNotice that in the outline above, I have numbered off five \"discourses\". Each of these five discourses ends, in English, with a phrase like \"When Jesus had finished these words...\" or \"When Jesus had finished these parables...\". Some who study Matthew will suggest an outline based around the five discourses. While I have not chosen to do so, this is a viable option as the discourses certainly form a critical part of Matthew's Gospel record.\n\nIn chapters four and five, Jesus re-enacts Moses by fasting for forty days and teaching on a mountain about God's law and the blessings/curses of obeying/disobeying it (see Exodus 24:18). This serves to fulfill Deuteronomy 18:15-19 where Moses promises that God will raise up another prophet like himself (Moses). The fact that Jesus did not give into temptation also validates His right to rule as the Messiah. It is interesting to compare Matthew's use of Jesus's temptation and fasting with Luke's argument based on the same events. For more about this discussion, refer to the summary for Luke.\n\n\n"},"new_testament/gospels_and_acts/mark.html":{"url":"new_testament/gospels_and_acts/mark.html","title":"Mark","keywords":"","body":"Mark\nAuthorship and Audience\nAccording to what Papias (c. 70 - 163 A.D.) had heard from the Apostle John, Mark (a.k.a. John Mark) recorded Peter's account of the Gospel. Thus, Mark is the one who physically wrote the gospel, but Peter is the one who dictated what should be written.\nAs far as audience is concerned: Based on the fact that Mark offers translations and explanations of Jewish words and customs (a few examples are: 3:17, 14:36, 7:3-4, and 15:42), it is likely that this Gospel was written to a Gentile audience. Mark also uses Latin loan-words rather than the Greek word for the same thing (a couple examples are: 5:9 and 15:16,39).\nDate and Context\nWhile there are many differing views on the order of the gospels and, therefore, the date of each one, I argue it is most likely that Mark was written after the book of Matthew. I also believe, based on the fact that the prophecy in Mark 13:2 is not described as already having been fulfilled, that the Gospel was written before the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. Thus, I would date the book of Mark somewhere in between 60 and 69 AD.\nBased on the testimony of early Church fathers and historical testimony that Peter was martyred in Rome, I believe that the book of Mark was written from Rome shortly before Peter's martyrdom.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe True Nature of Power. The book of Mark, written to an audience living in one of the most powerful nations in human history, demonstrates the true nature of power including its source, its end, and its proper use. Jesus Christ is powerfully and dramatically presented as the Messiah, and yet we find Christ submitting to the Father's will, even as that leads Him to the cross where He bears the separation from God the Father that we, ourselves, had earned.\n\nThe True Nature of Discipleship. Time and time again, Peter and Mark impress upon their audience what it means to be a disciple, that is a follower, of Jesus Christ. This is done through Christ's explicit teaching (8:34-38) and through numerous positive and negative examples that come up throughout the text (for a few examples, consider: 8:27-33, 1:16-20, and 14:50-52).\n\n\nOutline\n0. Christ Demonstrates His Power  [1 - 8:26]\nI. Hinge: How Can the Powerful Messiah Die? What Implications Does Christ's Death Have for Those Following Christ?  [8:27-38]\nII. Christ Submits His Power to the Father's Authority  [9 - 16]\nObservations/Notes\n\nMany have noted that Mark's incipit (the opening phrase of the book of Mark) is similar to the Priene Calendar Inscription which proclaimed the \"good tidings\" that Caesar Augustus, called a god, was bringing into the world. You can read a copy of the Priene Calendar Inscription and find more information about this topic here: http://craigaevans.com/Priene%20art.pdf.\n\nNotice that throughout the text, Mark emphasizes Jesus's activity in the Gentile areas to the North of Israel like Tyre, Sidon, and the Decapolis.\n\nOne of the interesting details about Mark's record of Jesus's trial is that Jesus Himself made sure that he was found guilty. The Jews were unable to provide credible, consistent testimony to provide Christ's guilt (14:59), but Jesus provides the evidence to seal His own fate (14:62).\n\nEven though it is an aside in the text, there has been much discussion about the the man in 14:51-52 who flees right out of the sheet he was using to cover himself. Some suggest that this was a 'cameo' appearance, if you will, of Mark himself. While this is certainly possible, it is important not to miss the meaning because we're too busy checking the spelling. The point of this passage, in a book that discusses the true nature of discipleship, is to highlight the fact that this man was so intent on fleeing Christ that he was willing to risk public shame and disgrace.\n\nIt is interesting to read Mark 10:42-43 in light of the fact that this book was likely written to a primarily Gentile audience This statement would have been quite an indictment for the original readers.\n\nThe gospel of Mark has multiple, possible endings. Some copies end the book of Mark at 16:8, others end at 16:8 but tack on another sentence, and still others end at 16:20 (see: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A8-20&version=NLT). All of the earliest manuscripts, however, simply end at verse 8. Thus, I believe verse 8 is the original ending of the work. It is likely that scribes added longer endings in order to soften the Mark's abrupt ending.\n\nAs far as the relationship between the Apostle Peter and Mark is concerned, 1 Peter 5:13 refers to Mark as \"my son\", signifying the closeness of their relationship.\n\nMore than the other gospel accounts, Mark accentuates the political undertones and ironies surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. When Jesus is sentenced, the Roman soldiers mock his kingship (15:16-20). When Jesus is crucified, the inscription put above Jesus reads \"The King of the Jews\" (15:26), which appears to be another political shot at the Jews in that the Jews were killing their own king at the hands of the Romans. One irony is that Jesus really is the King of the Jews and the entire world. Most of the Jews and the Romans simply did not recognize His power because they did not understand the true nature of Christ's power. Another irony is that because of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, He is now ruler over death itself and will one day return to exercise authority over death by banishing it once and for all (see 1 Corinthians 15:50-58 and Revelation 21)!\n\n\n"},"new_testament/gospels_and_acts/luke.html":{"url":"new_testament/gospels_and_acts/luke.html","title":"Luke","keywords":"","body":"Luke\nAuthorship and Audience\nBefore considering the author, it is important to note that Luke is part one of a presentation that continues into what we call the book of Acts (compare Luke 1:1-4 and Acts 1:1). As far as authorship is concerned, \"Luke-Acts\", as this combination of the two works is often known, was attributed to Luke by early church. Supporting evidence can be found in the book of Acts where the author, seventy seven times, uses the pronoun \"we\" to refer to himself and Paul (see Acts 16:10–17, 20:5–18, and 27-28:16). Thus, we know that the author of Luke-Acts was with Paul throughout some of his missionary journeys and Luke fits this description as he is mentioned in Paul's letters (Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:11, and Philemon 24) as a constant and faithful companion.\nThe particular audience of Luke-Acts is \"Theophilus\" (\"θεόφιλος\") as mentioned in Luke 1:3 and Acts 1:1. There is much debate as to the identity of \"Theophilus\", but there is nothing explicitly in the text. For the purpose of this summary, I will not delve into this any further as it enters the realm of conjecture and is not, in my estimation, essential to understanding Luke-Acts.\nDate and Context\nIt is likely that the book of Luke was written sometime between 60 - 62 AD. Support for this conclusion comes from the fact that, in 1 Timothy 5:18, Paul quotes Luke 10:7 (and interestingly enough refers to it as 'Scripture'). As 1 Timothy was likely written around 65 AD, Luke would have to be finished by this time. Paul was imprisoned in Rome around 60 to 62 AD, so this would have been an ideal time for Luke to gather eye-witness testimony and compile his account. There are other historical events which are not mentioned in Luke-Acts like the destruction of the temple (70 A.D.) and the martyrdom of James (62 A.D.) which also supports the view that the book of Luke was likely finished by 62 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nChrist is the Central Figure in World History. In his gospel account, Luke portrays Jesus as the one on whom the Old Testament prophecies and covenants depend and as the one who will change the future by establishing His kingdom and becoming a new, second Adam. Think of the history of the world as an hourglass, with Christ as the center. All history before Christ pointed to Him and all history after Christ stems from what Christ has begun. The, very long, introduction to the book of Luke (1 - 4:13) is, in fact, a microcosm of the whole book. We hear prophecies from Mary and Zechariah that echo Old Testament passages and speak of how God is fulfilling the covenants He made with Abraham and David. We also see from Christ's genealogy and temptation that Christ is, in a sense, a new Adam who did not fall to Satan and who is redeeming fallen man.\n\nChrist Came to Save ALL Men. Put another way, Christ came to offer salvation to all types of human beings. Poor, rich, male, female, free, slave, 'religious', 'un-religious', Jews, Gentiles, Roman, the list goes on and on... \nThis is evidenced in the gospel of Luke as Jesus ministers to both Jews and Gentiles. We find him dining with Pharisees (wealthy religious leaders) and tax collectors (also wealthy, but known for their greed and regarded as traitors for serving Rome). Jesus heals a Centurion's slave and has His feet anointed by a prostitute. It is hard, neigh impossible, to think of a group of people from Jesus's time to which He did not minister.\n\n\nOutline\n0.

Christ Resurrected  [23:56b - 24]\nObservations/Notes\n\nThe genealogy from Jesus back to Adam in Luke 3:23-38 plays a critical role in the development of Luke's argument. First, the genealogy itself makes a connection between Jesus Christ and Adam. This is something Luke will continue to build on throughout the rest of the book of Luke and into Acts. Like Adam, Christ's first coming was the start of something new (which underscores the significance of Christ's coming in human history). Second, zooming back in on Luke 3 and 4, the genealogy at the end of chapter 3 sets the reader up for Jesus's temptation in Luke 4:1-13. When you start reading chapter 4, the key question is: \"If Christ a 'new' Adam, will Christ fall like Adam did?\". Luke uses the genealogy to flow into Jesus's temptation where we see that Christ did not fall like the first Adam and will, indeed, start something new. Notice how both Matthew and Luke use the story of Christ's temptation to further their, albeit different, arguments. This is not to say that either one of them is wrong or reading into the events of Jesus's life, but simply that Christ's fulfillment of complex Old Testament prophecy about Himself was complete and the significance of this for the future is tremendous.\n\nMary's beautiful prayer of thanksgiving offered after she got the news that she would bear the Messiah (Luke 1:46-55) is often called the 'Magnificat'. It bears a strong resemblance to Hannah's prayer in 1 Samuel 2:1-10 as both prayers praise God for considering the humble and reversing the broken state of things. Through both women, God demonstrates how He feeds the starving and sends \"away the rich empty-handed\" (Luke 1:53b); how He gives strength to the weak and weakens the strong; how he has \"brought down rulers from their thrones, and has exalted those who were humble.\" (Luke 1:52).\n\n\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/","title":"Pauline Epistles","keywords":"","body":"Pauline Epistles\n(Romans - Philemon)\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/1_corinthians.html":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/1_corinthians.html","title":"1 Corinthians","keywords":"","body":"1 Corinthians\nAuthorship and Audience\nPer 1 Corinthians 1:1-2 and 16:21, this letter was written by Paul to the \"church of God which is at Corinth\" (1:2a).\nDate and Context\nThis letter was most likely written around 55 AD. This is evidenced by the fact that Paul was writing from Ephesus (see 1 Corinthians 16:8) where he stayed for three years (see Acts 20:31) likely between 53 to 55/56 AD. I claim Paul wrote 1 Corinthians toward the end of his stay in Ephesus based on 1 Corinthians 16:6 where Paul is making plans to spend the winter in Corinth.\nTheme(s)\n\nLife in the Church. One of the major themes throughout this letter is what life in the Church ought and ought not look like. Paul confronts the problems of disunity, lack of Church discipline, the misuse of communion, and the misuse of spiritual gifts, among other issues, and shows how these behaviors are unbecoming saints who \"belong to Christ\" (3:23).\n\nOutline\n0.

While this is certainly possible, I see no positive evidence that this is necessarily the case.\nWhen he first came to them, Paul spent eighteen months with the Corinthians (Acts 18:1-17). The letter of 1 Corinthians was written after this initial visit.\nAs evidenced by passages like 7:1, 8:1, and 12:1, Paul was writing this letter partly to confront issues with the Church and partly to respond to some questions the Corinthians had written him about. This gives us some tremendous insight into how the early church operated and how churches today ought to order themselves.\n1 Corinthians 11:24-25, part of a well known passage describing communion, is a reiteration of Jesus's words in Luke 22:19-20. Along with 1 Timothy 5:18, this passage affirms that Paul recognized Luke's account of the gospel as authoritative and useful for guiding the Church.

There is some debate as to whether Paul's visit to Jerusalem described in Galatians 2:1-10 was his attendance at the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15:4 or Paul's earlier visit to Jerusalem when delivering the money he collected for the poor as noted in Acts 11:30. While there are some difficult questions associated with both views, I believe that the book was most likely written before the Jerusalem Council. Regardless of the exact chronology, Paul was writing to the Galatian believers who were dealing with false teaching from so called 'Judiazers' who were teaching that true believers needed to follow Mosaic law in order to be saved and sanctified. Thus, Paul writes this letter to clarify the purpose of the law and the true means of salvation.\nTheme(s)\nThe letter to the Galatians can be summed up as a contrast between two teachings:\n\nGospel according to man\nGospel according to Paul (and the Apostles)\n\nAll in all, the main point of this letter is to define what the Gospel is and what the Gospel is not.

Paul establishes that the Gospel revealed to him by Christ leads to righteousness when believed in faith (with no works of the Law required) and even in the Old Testament, righteousness was through faith. Paul provides the Galatians with a wonderful explanation of the role of the Mosaic law in the plan of God in chapters three and four.\n\nFreedom vs. Slavery  This letter establishes the foundational principle that believers in Christ are free from slavery to the law and any other restrictions as means by which they must earn/achieve salvation. This principle is often called Christian Liberty and Paul will explain why Christians have freedom in Christ (3:10-14) and how it ought to be used (see 5:13).\n\nSpirit vs. Flesh  The Judiazers were telling the believers in Galatia that they had to do something in their flesh (meaning physical bodies) in order to earn salvation (3:3, 5:2, 5:4). Paul points out that salvation and the Christian life itself is not based on keeping the law in the flesh, but on walking in the Spirit (3:3, 5:4-6). Latter in the letter, Paul uses the term 'flesh' to refer not just to our physical bodies, but specifically to the sin nature made manifest in our bodies. He contrasts this sinful flesh with the Spirit in passages like 5:13-26.\n\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1:1-5]\nI. Paul Defends his Gospel and The Role of Faith Therein  [1:6 - 2:21]\nII.

Here, Paul records his confrontation with the Apostle Peter when Peter was hypocritically \"fearing the party of the circumcision\" (2:12).\nFrom this letter, we get a good sense of the true authority behind the Gospel message... it isn't authoritative because of any merit in the one proclaiming it, but because Christ Himself is revealing it as noted in 1:11-12 (see also 1:8-9).\n\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/ephesians.html":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/ephesians.html","title":"Ephesians","keywords":"","body":"Ephesians\nAuthorship and Audience\nPaul (see 1:1) wrote this book possibly to the Church in Ephesus (see 1:1 and one of the notes below that deals with the intended audience of this book). Regardless of the exact, geographic location of the audience, it is clear that Paul was writing to Gentiles. Numerous times, mostly in the first three chapters, Paul differentiates between the Jews and his audience (see 1:12-13, 2:11, 2:13, 2:19, 3:1).\nDate and Context\nThis letter, known as a prison epistle, was likely written while by Paul while he was imprisoned in Rome between 60 and 62 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Church  One of the primary themes in this book is the Church. This first half of the book covers its formation, both from the perspective of God's eternal, global plan in chapter one and God's personal salvation of individuals in chapter two, its purpose, and its composition. The second half of the book addresses the implications of being part of the Church. In other words, how those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ must live now that they are part of the Church.

As such, I break the book down into two primary themes:\n\nLive as Citizens of Heaven (vs. 27).  Paul stresses the importance and means of living in a way that is worthy of the Gospel to which believers have been called.\n\nHandle Opposition Well (vs. 28-30).  Paul also encourages believers in Philippi to handle suffering and false teachers well (that is, appropriately). I believe one of the reasons Paul mentions \"joy\" and \"rejoice\" so much throughout this letter is to highlight the fact that joy and rejoicing are appropriate responses even when suffering. Recall from Acts 16:22–34 that Paul and Silas had dramatically modeled this kind of rejoicing when they spent part of a night in the Philippian prison. Additionally, Paul wants to make sure that the Philippians respond well to false teachers by not letting such teachers draw them off course, away from the true Gospel.\n\n\nOutline\n0.

This letter was also to be passed on the to the believers in Laodicea to be read there and a letter which was also sent to Laodicea was to be read by the Colossians (see 4:16).\nDate and Context\nWe know that Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter (see 4:10 and 18), but are not certain from which imprisonment he was writing. Many scholars have argued that this book was written during Paul's Roman imprisonment, but there are others who disagree. Regardless of when this was written, we know that Colossae was being inundated with false teaching(s) that celebrated the worship of Angels, asceticism, and keeping the traditions of man.\nTheme(s)\n\nChrist's Authority Over All Things. One of the underlying principles throughout the book of Colossians is that Christ has authority over everything. Be it the dominion of darkness (1:13), creation (1:15), the Church (1:18 and 2:19), every rule and authority (2:10 and 15), the \"elementary principles of the world\" (2:20), or cultural, ethnic, racial, social divisions (3:11 and 4:9), Christ has authority and power over it. Throughout this book, Paul will discuss the implications of Christ's authority as it relates to everything from the worship of angels (2:18) to the everyday life of a Roman family (3:18 - 4:1).\n\nOutline\n0.

Resurrection Living (or: Living in Light of Christ's Authority)  [3:1 - 4:6]\nV. Personal Greetings and Conclusion  [4:7-18]\nObservations/Notes\n\nWhen Christ is called the \"firstborn\" (\"πρωτότοκος\") of all creation and of the dead, it is not suggesting that Christ is a created being who was born at some point in the past. It is instead underscoring Christ's headship and preeminence. This is evidenced by the fact that the phrase \"firstborn\" is used of the Messiah in Psalm 89:27 and indirectly in Psalm 2:7. Hebrews 1:1-14 is in many ways a parallel passage with Colossians 1:15-20, and Hebrews 1:4-6 refers to Christ as both \"son\" (quoting Psalm 2:7 and 2 Samuel 7:14) and \"firstborn\".\n\nColossians 2:16-17 provides a descriptive image that highlights the authority and preeminence of Christ. Paul first points out that things like keeping the Sabbath, celebrating new-moon sacrifices and festivals, and keeping regulations regarding food and drink are all a \"shadow of what is to come\". The \"substance\", that is the object of which the shadow is indicative, is Christ. All of the legal regulations provided in the Old Testament were a \"shadow\" that ultimately points to Christ. This means that Christ is what is significant and not the keeping of the Old Testament regulations.\n\n\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/1_thessalonians.html":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/1_thessalonians.html","title":"1 Thessalonians","keywords":"","body":"1 Thessalonians\nAuthorship and Audience\nPaul to the church in Thessalonica which, at the time this book was written, may have had a population around a couple hundred thousand.\nDate and Context\nThis letter was more than likely written after Timothy returned to Paul in Corinth after visiting Thessalonica (see 3:2 and Acts 18:5). From Acts 18:12-17, we know that while Paul was in Corinth, he went before the \"proconsul of Achaia\" named Gallio (Acts 18:12) and left shortly there after (Acts 18:18). Based on an inscription known as the \"Delphi Inscription\"† or the \"Gallio Inscription\", we know that Gallio was the proconsul between 51 and 52 AD. Thus, assuming the first letter to the Thessalonians was written before Paul went before Gallio and left Corinth, it must have also been written before 52 AD. Thus, it is safe to say that this letter was likely written around 50-51 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nEschatology (the study of the end times).  Both the first and second letter to the Thessalonians deal with the issue of Eschatology. In this book, Paul describes what happens to those who have died before Christ returns. In both letters, we also get a good picture of how Christians ought to be living in light of Christ's immanent return (5:1-11).\nA Picture of a Healthy Church.  While it may be a stretch to call this a theme, we get a good feel for what a relatively healthy church ought to look like and be doing from this book. Paul time and time again commends them for their faith (1:6 and 9-10), love (4:9), testimony (1:7-10), and encouragement (5:11).\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction and Greeting  [1:1-10]\nI.

If Paul is, indeed, writing this letter from Corinth, it would have been written sometime between 50 and 52 A.D. (refer to the \"Date and Context\" section for 1 Thessalonians for more details on why this is the case). It is most likely that the letter was written to the very end of Paul's time in Corinth, thus sometime between 51 and 52 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nReturn of Christ.  Like 1 Thessalonians, this book deals with eschatology (the study of the end times). In particular, 2 Thessalonians provides details about what will happen before Christ returns when the so-called Man of Lawlessness is revealed. Like the first letter, this letter is concerned with how we live in light of Christ's return (2:13-15).\nLiving a Disciplined Life.

Either Paul did not write the book (and the book was likely not written during Paul's lifetime), or Paul wrote this letter after the events recorded in the book of Acts. I believe the latter view is more likely as Paul himself hints that he will be released from prison in Philippians 1:25-26 and 2:24 as well as Philemon 22. Thus, this letter was likely written after Paul was released from his first, Roman imprisonment around 63-64 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nInstructions for Leaders/Teachers.  As this book was written to a young leader/teacher in the early Church, this book is helpful in providing instructions for young leaders. While we must remember the author, audience, and context in which this book was written, it is appropriate to note that even teachers today can glean from this instructive and personal letter.\nRight Conduct in the Church.  As noted in point III of the outline below, Paul spends over two chapters (1 Timothy 2 - 4:5) discussing \"how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God\" (1 Timothy 3:15). This is a central theme that underlies most of the general teaching Paul provides and the specific instructions given to Timothy later in the book.\n\nOutline\n0. Greeting  [1:1-2]\nI.

Some go so far as to use this as an objection to Pauline authorship, but this is founded in the invalid assumption that an author must (and can only) use the same words and constructs throughout everything he/she writes regardless of the audience and genre of the written work.\nIt is very evident from this letter how well Paul knew Timothy. Verses like 1:18, 5:23, and 6:20 are reminders of the close relationship they shared.\n1 Timothy 5:18 is particularly interesting as Paul quotes Luke 10:7 along side of Deuteronomy 25:4 as \"scripture\". In this way, Paul affirms that Luke's gospel account should be recognized as scripture and is worthy of being used with the Old Testament scriptures. Paul makes similar references to Luke's gospel in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 (see the notes on 1 Corinthians for more details).\n\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/2_timothy.html":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/2_timothy.html","title":"2 Timothy","keywords":"","body":"2 Timothy\nAuthorship and Audience\nThis letter was written by Paul (1:1) to Timothy (1:2).\nDate and Context\nAs Paul was writing this letter from prison (1:16-18; 2:9), it was likely written around 66-67 A.D. during Paul's second, Roman imprisonment. \nTheme(s)\n\nBe Faithful!

Final Benediction  [4:22]\nObservations/Notes\n\n2 Timothy is more than likely Paul's last letter. Paul is not hopeful of being released from his imprisonment (4:6) and, as such, is:\nJoyful in the hope and rewards which await him (4:6-8).\nIntent on passing the Gospel on to the next generation (and ensuring they do the same) (2:2-7).\n\n\nWhen Paul says \"last days\" in 2 Timothy 3:1, we need to keep in mind that the \"last days\" began at Pentecost as Peter points out in his sermon (refer to the entirety of Acts 2, specifically Acts 2:16-17). That is to say, we should not be surprised to see \"lovers of self, lovers of money\" and the like. These have always been and will continue to be all the more until Christ returns and starts His kingdom here on earth.\nThis book reminds us of the apparent frailty of the Church. If Timothy and those in his generation had failed to pass on the Gospel, it seems that the Church would no longer exist today. I say \"apparent\" and \"it seems\" because in the same breath that we rightly underscore the role of faithful men in the life and perpetuation of the Church, we must also highlight God's sovereignty over the Church (see Colossians 2:18-19 and Ephesians 1:15-23). I do not believe that the Church will disappear till Christ raptures her, but it is still tremendously important that each generation is faithful to pass the gospel on to the next.\n\n"},"new_testament/pauline_epistles/philemon.html":{"url":"new_testament/pauline_epistles/philemon.html","title":"Philemon","keywords":"","body":"Philemon\nAuthorship and Audience\nWritten by Paul to Philemon (vs. 1), a Christian in Colosse, along with Apphia and Archippus (2).\nDate and Context\nPhilemon was a relatively wealthy man who owned a slave named \"Onesiumus\". It appears from the text that this slave had run away from Philemon and had found Paul, who was imprisoned in Rome. While with Paul in Rome, Onesiumus became a believer (10) and became useful to Paul in his ministry (11 and 13). Paul then sends Onesiumus back to his master in hopes that:\n\nThe relationship between Philemon and Onesiumus can be mended (10, 15-19).\nPhilemon will send Onesiumus back to help serve Paul in his ministry (12-14, 20).\n\nTheme(s)\n\nThe ground is level at the foot of the Cross.  One of the foundational themes of this book is that, in Christ, a slave and his/her master can both worship together as equals before Christ. Once you have spiritual life in Christ, your primary identity is not defined by your social, economic, or political status, but by the fact that you are in Christ.

It highlights the personal relationship Paul had with Philemon and reinforces the power of doing something from goodwill rather than compulsion (8-9).\nIn a lecture on this book, Martin Luther referred to some verses in this letter saying: \"This is good flattery; but it is holy, because it proceeds as in Christ.\"[1].\nFor more on what the Bible has to say to slaves and masters, read Ephesians 6:5-9 and Colossians 3:22 - 4:1.\nOnesiumus's name means \"useful\", \"beneficial\", or \"profitable\".

Our biggest clue, which leads us to, frankly, nothing more than conjecture, is the writing style, structure, and vocabulary used throughout the book. There are many people who have been considered by some to be the authors of this book including Paul, Apollos, and Luke. In truth, it is very hard to identify who it was based solely on evidence from the text. Honestly, it doesn't really matter who wrote Hebrews anyway as it has been recognized as being inspired by God Himself.\nAs far as the audience of the book is concerned, the traditional, Greek title of the work was \"To the Hebrews\" and, based on the Jewish themes discussed throughout the book, the name has remained to this day.\nDate and Context\nBased on the fact that the destruction of the Temple is not mentioned and that the book uses the present tense to describe priestly activity, it is likely that this letter was written sometime between 60 - 69 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nThe Superiority of Christ.  Upon reading this letter, there is little question that one of the major themes of this book is convincing and reminding the reader that Christ is superior to anything the Old Covenant has to offer.

It may be wrong and is subject to change as often as I feel is appropriate: While we cannot positively pin-point the author of this book based on the text, I do believe we can rule out at least one author that is popularly believed to have written this book: Paul. Many argue that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews and I strongly disagree based on Hebrews 2:3. In this verse, the author groups himself with the audience in being second generation Christians who heard the good news of salvation, not directly from the Lord, but from first generation believers who had heard it from God.\nThere are some difficult theological and interpretive challenges with the book of Hebrews. One of the more well-known passages in Hebrews 6:1-8 where it seems to say that it is possible to be truly saved and to then fall away. This is a big challenge for those who believe in Eternal Security also known as Perseverance of the Saints (both of which describe the view that anyone who is truly saved cannot and will not fall away from the faith - which seems to be supported by passages like John 10:28 among others).\nThe letter spends no time on introduction begins with some potent theology. In this way, it reminds me of John 1. While abrupt, realize that the first two and half verses (according to my outline above) are foundational for the view of Christ that is laid out in the rest of the book of Hebrews.\n\n"},"new_testament/general_epistles/james.html":{"url":"new_testament/general_epistles/james.html","title":"James","keywords":"","body":"James\nAuthorship and Audience\nThe author of this letter is James (vs.1), most likely James the half-brother of Jesus (for more details on this, see the observations). This letter was written \"to the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad\" which I believe to mean Jews (likely believers based on the repeated use of \"my brethren\" throughout the book) who were scattered throughout the Roman empire.\nDate and Context\nAssuming the letter was truly written by James, the half-brother of Jesus, it must have been finished before his martyrdom in 62 AD. Also, there is no mention of the Jerusalem Council in this book so it is distinctly possible that this book was written before the Jerusalem Council which is described in Acts 15 and likely occurred around 50 AD. Thus, the book may have been written some time before 50 AD and at latest before 62 AD. If the book were indeed written before 50 A.D., it is likely chronologically the earliest book from the New Testament to have been written.\nTheme(s)\n\nChristian Wisdom.  In this book, James both provides and describes Christian wisdom. He is providing Christian wisdom when he talks about how to live as believers in different situations. He describes Christian wisdom itself in James 3:13-18.\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nAs to the authorship of this book, there are four people named \"James\" in the New Testament. Two of the \"James-es\" are obscure and not likely the authors of this book. Therefore, the only serious considerations for authorship are James, the half-brother of Jesus, and James, the Apostle (son of Zebedee). The Apostle James was martyred by King Herod in Acts 12:1-2 (around 44 A.D.) which is generally regarded as too early to have written this book. Therefore, the author is likely Jesus's half-brother, James.\nThis book is often called the \"Proverbs of the New Testament\" as it sounds proverbial at times and speaks about wisdom, the tongue, and money (as do the proverbs).\nJames 2:14-25, a well known passage describing the relationship between faith and works, is, for some, a difficult passage to understand in light of other passages in the Bible the clearly teach that salvation comes through faith alone (Romans 4:1-12, for example). James is often seen as contradicting Paul or as adding works to the list of necessary requirements for salvation. Rightly understood, however, the passages in which James deals with faith and works are presenting works as the necessary result of genuine faith (see the observation below of an explanation of one of the more challenging passages in this book).\nJames 2:21-24 was. for me, a particularly challenging passage. Taken on its own, it seems to say that the statement \"And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness\" from Genesis 15:6 was fulfilled only when he was about to kill Isaac on the alter (in Genesis 22). Based on Paul's argument in Romans 4:9-12 where he states that Abraham was justified as described in Genesis 15:6 before he was circumcised, and thus before he sacrificed Isaac, we can posit that either James is indeed contradicting Paul or that the word \"fulfilled\" in James 2:23 does not imply that Abraham's justification by faith was previously unfulfilled. I suggest that the latter is true and that the word \"fulfilled\" is being used to describe the clear manifestation of that which has already been fulfilled. If you think I'm stretching things too far by saying this, consider that a similar use of the word \"fulfilled\" occurs in Acts 13:33. I believe the word \"justified\" is being used in a similar manner to describe the manifestation of that which was already accomplished. In other words, both faith and works are evidence that someone has been justified.\n\n"},"new_testament/general_epistles/2_peter.html":{"url":"new_testament/general_epistles/2_peter.html","title":"2 Peter","keywords":"","body":"2 Peter\nAuthorship and Audience\nIn terms of authorship, this book is among the most widely disputed books in the New Testament. When mentioning the book, Origen (185 - 253) notes that there were some who disputed Petrine authorship of this book. Many modern scholars concur in saying that Peter was not the author of 2 Peter. There is a good discussion of this debate in the \"Introduction\" section here. I will leave it to you to investigate these claims as there has already been much ink spilled about the subject and I have nothing more to contribute. Personally, I find the most compelling argument against Petrine authorship is the significant difference in the quality and character of language used in 1 Peter versus that of 2 Peter. I feel this can be easily explained, however, by 1 Peter 5:12 which implies that Silvanus was an amenuensis who had better Greek than Peter, who wrote 2 Peter with his own hand. Thus, I support Petrine authorship of this letter.\nAs to the audience of this book. verse one states that the audience is believers. 2 Peter 3:1 refers to 1 Peter, so it is reasonable to assume that the audience of 2 Peter had received or was familiar with 1 Peter (see Authorship and Audience section for that book). 2 Peter 3:15 also notes that the audience had received a letter from Paul at one point. Although we don't know of any Pauline letter addressed to believers in the churches mentioned as the audience of 1 Peter, it could be that Paul's letters were passed around to those churches or that Paul had written other letters of which we are not aware.\nDate and Context\nAssuming this letter was indeed written by Peter and that the tradition is correct in saying that Peter was killed by Nero, Nero died in 68 A.D. which means that this letter was written, at the latest, before or during 68 AD. 2 Peter 1:14 shows that Peter thought his death was imminent which, if correct, would date this letter shortly before or during 68 AD.\n"},"new_testament/general_epistles/1_john.html":{"url":"new_testament/general_epistles/1_john.html","title":"1 John","keywords":"","body":"1 John\nAuthorship and Audience\nBy the testimony of the early Church, the Apostle John was the author of this book. Internally (that is, within the book itself), this is supported by the authority with which the author writes. While the audience is not mentioned by name, it is clear that the Apostle John knew his audience very well. The repeated references to \"little children\", \"children\", and \"beloved\" are evidence of this.\nDate and Context\nBecause there are no references to historical events at the time the book was written, this book is difficult to date. Because John is addressing what appears to be an early form of Gnosticism in this letter, it is usually dated toward the end of John's life between 90 and 95 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nQUESTIONS: What does it look like to have fellowship with God? and How can we be sure that we have fellowship with God?  Based on the introduction to 1 John (1:1-4) and the thesis given in 5:13, I believe the primary purpose for this book is to detail what it looks like to have fellowship with God and how to know with certainty that we have this fellowship.\nPRINCIPLE 1: Like Father, Like Son.  To answer the question, John assumes the following principle: Like Father, Like Son. That is: a child will naturally act like his/her parents. This is true of our biological families and, as described in this book, it is also true of our spiritual sonship with God. Simply put, if we are children of God, we will naturally display (to an extent appropriate with our position as creatures) the same attributes found in God. If God is kind and loving, the children of God should likewise be kind and loving. If God is not kind or loving, the children of God should be neither kind nor loving. Assuming this principle is true, the critical question now becomes: What are the attributes of God? with a specific view towards those attributes which are to be displayed in His children. This question is answered by principles two and three given below.\nPRINCIPLE 2: God is Light.  God's essential Holiness (described as \"light\" in 1:5) is identified by the Apostle John as one of the attributes of God which must be displayed in His children (1:6-7).\nPRINCIPLE 3: God is Love.  Like God's Holiness mentioned in the previous point, the fact that God is love forms the foundation for John's argument that the one who does not love, does not have fellowship with the God who is love (4:8). In other words, those who have fellowship with God will love because God, their father, also loved.\nANSWER: Fellowship with God looks like displaying and pursuing God's holiness and love as His children.  If we are truly children of God, we will live like our Heavenly Father. Increasingly living in this way gives us the confidence that we are true children of God and have fellowship with Him.\n\nObservations/Notes\n\nThe opening verses (1:1-4) are reminiscent of John 1:1-5.\nThe reason why John wrote the letter given in 5:13 is very similar to the one given in John 20:31.\nIt is interesting that in the Gospel of John, Jesus's \"I am\" statements are recorded and in this book there are two \"God is\" statements (\"God is Light\" (1:5) and \"God is love\" (4:8 and 16)).\nIn my opinion, this book is one of the most difficult books to outline. John is very repetitive and there are numerous topics that are brought up throughout the book which makes it hard to outline. For the time being, I am not going to publish an outline for this book as I do not think any the outlines I have come up with are sufficient to accurately capture this book.\nThere are some apparent contradictions in this book, especially regarding sin in the life of the believer. For example, John says that \"No one who abides in Him sins\" (3:6) while he earlier (2:1) makes it clear that it is possible for true believers to sin. In most English translations, the word for \"sin\" is the same in both verses. In the Greek, however, the verb \"sin\" in 2:1 (\"ἁμάρτητε\") is in the Aorist) tense while the verb in 3:6 (\"ἁμαρτάνει\") is in the present tense. This implies that the two references to \"sin\" are not meant in the same sense. The reference in 2:1 describes the discrete action of sin without reference to the process of sinning or the consequences. The reference in 3:6 describes current sin (with the implication that sin is common and a habitual practice).\n\n"},"new_testament/general_epistles/2_john.html":{"url":"new_testament/general_epistles/2_john.html","title":"2 John","keywords":"","body":"2 John\nAuthorship and Audience\nThe text refers to the sender as \"the elder\" (vs. 1) and to the recipient as the \"chosen lady and her children\". Based on the testimony of tradition and the similarities between this letter and 1 John, it is very likely that the author is the Apostle John. There is some debate about the identity of this \"chosen lady\". Some argue she is likely a reference to the church, others argue she was a literal woman. Both of these views are possible so, until proven otherwise, I choose to hold the most simple, literal view that the lady is referring to a literal woman.\nDate and Context\nAccording to tradition, the Apostle John served and died in Ephesus toward the later part of his life. It is likely that this letter was written from Ephesus sometime around 90 AD.\nTheme(s)\n\nDiscerning Love Rejects False Teachers.  If we are commanded to love one another, does this love manifest itself in the same way toward those who deny that Christ came in the flesh and those who accept the truth of Christ? John's answer is emphatically \"No!\". The love between believers is different because both parties acknowledge God's commands (see verse 6). A right, loving response to those teaching a false gospel is to not support him/her in any way which would make you participant \"in his evil deeds\" (11).\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1-3]\nI. Love One Another  [4-6]\nII. Identifying and Relating to False Teachers  [7-11]\nIII. Conclusion  [12-13]\nObservations/Notes\n\nThis is a short book. In verse 12, John mentions that he does not want to write them with \"paper and ink\" possibly because he was running low on resources and hoped to see them in person soon. He closes 3 John with a similar phrase (3 John 13).\nThis book is reminiscent of 1 John as it contains many of the same phrases in the first six verses.\n\"Truth\" is a word that is commonly used throughout this book as well as 3 John. The Apostle John is glad to see believers walking in the truth and responding appropriately to the truth in obedience.\nLike 3 John, this book emphasizes the importance and significance of service rendered to those who are proclaiming the truth (or a false 'truth'). It is very important who you support financially, in prayer, and in hospitality. You have the choice of being \"fellow workers with the truth\" (3 John 8) or being one who \"participates in his evil deeds\" (2 John 11). Discernment is an essential attribute of true, God honoring love.\n\n"},"new_testament/general_epistles/3_john.html":{"url":"new_testament/general_epistles/3_john.html","title":"3 John","keywords":"","body":"3 John\nAuthorship and Audience\nAccording to verse 1, this letter was written by \"the elder\", likely a reference to the Apostle John (see notes on 2 John for more on this). The letter is addressed to a specific person named Gaius. This was a common name in Bible times also used in Acts 19:29, 20:4, Romans 16:23, and 1 Corinthians 1:14.

In this book, Gaius is encouraged to continue supporting and receiving those who are teaching the truth because, in doing so, he is proving himself to be a \"fellow worker\" (8).

In verse seventeen of this letter, the author differentiates himself from the other Apostles, thus implying that the author was not the Apostle Judas, but Judas, Jesus' brother. The letter is addressed broadly to those who are \"called beloved in God the Father, kept for Jesus Christ...\" (1b). Based on the references to the Old Testament stories and even stories from the Book of Enoch (verses 9 and 14-15), it is possible the audience is Jewish believers with whom these stories would have resonated.\nDate and Context\nBased on the similarities with 2 Peter, this book was likely written shortly after that book. Thus, sometime between 65 and 80 A.D. is most likely.\nTheme(s)\n\nContending Earnestly for the Faith.  This book encourages its audience to contend for the faith by identifying the \"hidden reefs\" (vs. 12), avoiding their teaching and practice (20-21), and saving others from their destructive teachings and practice (22-23).\nThe inevitable judgement coming on those who turn the gospel of God into licentiousness and deny Jesus Christ.  As described in this book, judgement against those who reject Christ and live as \"unreasoned animals\" (10) is inevitable. It has occurred in the past (see 5-7 and 14-16) and will occur again as such people are already \"marked out for this condemnation\" (4).\n\nOutline\n0. Introduction  [1-2]\nI.

Closing Doxology  [24-25]\nObservations/Notes\n\nVerse 9 contains a quote from the Book of Enoch to show the respect that even Michael, the archangel, has for \"angelic majesties\".\nVerses 14 and 15 also contain a quote from the Book of Enoch that describes the fate of those \"ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ\" (vs 4).\nThese references to the Book of Enoch do not imply that the Book of Enoch should be included in the canon or that the Book of Enoch was divinely inspired. These are simply a useful stories that, ostensibly, would have been familiar to the original audience.\nThis book contains much in common with 2 Peter. The use of Old Testament stories to highlight God's judgement (2 Peter 2:4-10a), reviling of angelic authorities (2 Peter 2:10b-11), living unreasoned lives based on instinct like an animal (2 Peter 2:12), and vivid metaphors (2 Peter 2:17) are all topics/characteristics shared by both 2 Peter and Jude. In fact, Jude 18 is almost a direct quote from 2 Peter 3:3.\nVerse 12 and 13 contain some of the most vivid imagery anywhere in the Bible. Jude uses such clear, imaginative metaphors to describe those who deny Jesus Christ and pursue licentiousness.\n\n"}}}
