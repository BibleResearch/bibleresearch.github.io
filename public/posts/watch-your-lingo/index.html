<p>We are living in what is quickly becoming a post-Christian culture. As such, pastors, teachers, leaders, and even lay Christians need to wake up to the reality that Christian jargon widely understood in previous generations is no longer understood by the vast majority of people under the age of 30.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Last time communion was served at my Church, I heard the familiar phrase: &ldquo;If you are not a believer, please let the elements pass you by&rdquo;. Having grown up around the Church, I know what this means, but would a visitor really know what we mean by &ldquo;let the elements pass you by&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m not too sure given the fact that &lsquo;the elements&rsquo; were never defined and I frankly have no idea why the bread and wine are even called &lsquo;elements&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Do you use the term &ldquo;Gospel&rdquo; a lot? I hope so, but I also hope you define it. Given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_gospel#Etymology">etymology</a> of the word, it is no surprise that very few non-Christians today know what this word means. Please, please, please don&rsquo;t use it without defining it (and when you do define it, make sure you define it correctly).</p>

<h3 id="danger-jargon-becomes-an-argot">Danger - Jargon Becomes an Argot</h3>

<p>If we are not careful to define our terms, we run the risk of being unable to communicate or mis-communicating the Gospel to younger generations. There is nothing wrong with having jargon. In fact this is perfectly natural to develop jargon given the importance and unique nature of Divine Revelation. But there is a fine line between <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jargon">jargon</a> and an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/argot">argot</a>.</p>

<h3 id="danger-jargon-becomes-a-crutch">Danger - Jargon Becomes a Crutch</h3>

<p>Additionally, I am wary of using Christian jargon not only for the sake of the audience and those who may not have a good understanding of the Bible, but also for the sake of the speakers/writers. I regularly force myself to avoid using jargon and to define the thing itself using common (read non-jargon) language. This makes me remember and articulate what it actually means as well as remember where the Bible talks about it. For example, it is easy to throw around the term &lsquo;sanctification&rsquo;, but can you put it into relatively simple terms? Can you then cite Biblical support for your definition? Jargon is fantastic, perfectly natural, and even essential, but it can become a crutch. Jargon is a ship which slowly but steadily drifts farther and farther from the shore of definition and the safe harbor of Scripture.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Keep using (most) jargon! But also take the time to define what those terms mean. This will allow you to more effectively minister to those who did not grow up in the Church and it will help your jargon remaining rooted in the Bible and focused on Christ.</p>
