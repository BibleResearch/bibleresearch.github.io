What a shame that a Christian college recently had to shut down its foreign languages department due to a lack of interest. At this college, learning Koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew is highly honored, as it should be; yet Spanish, French, Chinese, and German classes are a thing of the past due to lack of demand.
I find it tragic that in our haste to understand the bible we often forget that part of our calling is to communicate the truth we discover.</description></item></channel></rss>
