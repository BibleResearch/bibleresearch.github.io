      <description>Question In Galatians 4:21-31, is Paul interpreting the Old Testament allegorically? He certainly appears to be doing so based on 4:24.
This is a significant question because it provides a glimpse into Paul&amp;rsquo;s hermeneutics. A broader question would be: Did Paul support an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament?
Background Galatians 4:24 The difficult verse is Galatians 4:24 which, in the NASB, is translated:
