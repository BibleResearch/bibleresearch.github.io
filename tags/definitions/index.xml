This is dangerous and inaccurate for (at least) two reasons:
It confuses pragmatism and function with ontology (there is more on the danger of Pragmaticism here). It includes consequences in the definition rather than just the grounds. This breaks a basic principle of creating definitions, namely &amp;ldquo;that the attributes included in the definition should be always such as are the ground of the others rather than the consequences&amp;rdquo;1.</description></item></channel></rss>
