      <description>The record of human history demonstrates that God does three, wonderful things for mankind: He saves; He satisfies; He sustains. Psalm 62 celebrates these wonderful truths and emphasizes God&amp;rsquo;s unique ability to provide in each area.
Background According to the superscription, Psalm 62 is a psalm of David. While there is no explicit, historical context for the psalm, it refers to those who &amp;ldquo;assail a man that you may murder him&amp;rdquo; (Psalm 62:3).</description>

      <description>Psalm 90 deals with one of the most basic challenges facing humanity: If there really is a sovereign, holy God who created everything and knows our every thought but is also immanent, how can man live and find meaning in living?
Before we begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
 Sovereignty of God: God&amp;rsquo;s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.</description>
