I would like to challenge you with Jesus' words on forgiveness. Jesus is not flippant or trivial on the topic of forgiveness and he attributes a weight and significance to forgiveness that is, I think, often lessened. I hope you will consider the practical implications of Jesus' words for your own life. In the words of Paul: Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.</description></item></channel></rss>
