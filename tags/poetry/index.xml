Deep in unfathomable mines Of never-failing skill He treasures up His bright designs, And works His sovereign will.
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take, The clouds ye so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In blessings on your head.
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust Him for His grace; Behind a frowning providence He hides a smiling face.</description></item><item><title>Was Satan Suprised?</title><link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/was-satan-suprised/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bible.hightower.space/posts/was-satan-suprised/</guid><description>Was Satan surprised&amp;hellip; too busy looking at Job to see Jesus?
too busy deceiving the eves to notice the ave&amp;hellip; maria who, through no merit of her own and though a sinner such as I, was blessed to bring into the fallen, dirty world one who, in ages past, had made the oceans whirl and rivers swirl?
Was Satan surprised&amp;hellip; too busy roaming about on the earth?
too busy building Babel to notice a babe in Bethlehem&amp;hellip; who, by submission to His Fatherâ€™s will and because of His great love with which He loved us, would bless sinners with reconciliation and an inheritance?</description></item></channel></rss>
