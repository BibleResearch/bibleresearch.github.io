      <title>The Performative Nature of Wisdom Literature</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</link>

      <description>Performative Wisdom Literature In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1 This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something. Language itself can do things. For example, saying &amp;ldquo;I now pronounce you husband and wife&amp;rdquo; in the proper context is not just a declarative statement about what I happen to be doing at the moment.</description>

      <title>Psalm 62: God&#39;s Unique Ability to Save, Satisfy, and Sustain</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/psalm-62/</link>

      <description>Background According to the superscription, Psalm 62 is a psalm of David. While there is no explicit, historical context for the psalm, it refers to those who &amp;ldquo;assail a man that you may murder him&amp;rdquo; (Psalm 62:3). There were multiple points in David&amp;rsquo;s life when people were seeking to kill him, so this psalm could have been inspired by many of the events in David&amp;rsquo;s life.
Structure The psalm breaks down into five sections:</description>

      <title>Cain &amp; Abel</title>

      <description>Genesis 4:1-15 describes the infamous story of Cain and Abel. In this story, two brothers, Cain (a &amp;ldquo;tiller of the ground&amp;rdquo;) and Abel (a &amp;ldquo;keeper of flocks&amp;rdquo;), bring a sacrifice before God (see Genesis 4:2-3). Verses three and four tell us that Cain brings &amp;ldquo;an offering of the fruit of the ground&amp;rdquo; and Abel brings &amp;ldquo;the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions&amp;rdquo;. The end of verse four and beginning of verse five reads: &amp;ldquo;And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard.</description>

      <title>Psalm 90: The Problem of God&#39;s Immanence</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</link>

      <guid>//bible.hightower.space/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</guid>
      <description>Before we begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
 Sovereignty of God: God&amp;rsquo;s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.
 If both of these attributes, as well as Holiness and Omniscience, are accurate descriptions of God&amp;rsquo;s character (and they are according to the testimony of Psalm 90 and scripture as a whole), then humans have a big problem; A God who is sovereign (in control), omniscient (knows everything a man does, thinks and feels), holy (separated and opposed to evil), and immanent (He relates with His creation) will produce a conundrum where God interacts and relates with His creation (due to His immanence) while killing them for their sin (because of His omniscience, sovereignty, and holiness).</description>

      <title>The Spies&#39; Bad Report</title>

      <description>What is described below is, in my estimation, a well-supported conjecture, but a conjecture nonetheless. Consider it thoughtfully and critically.
I believe that Numbers 13:25-33 can be broken down as follows:
 Numbers 13:25-26 - General summary of events. Spies return and give their report. Numbers 13:27-29 - This is said by the spies (particularly the ten spies who did not believe God) privately to Moses (at least not in the hearing of the people before Moses).</description>

      <title>The Audacity of Man-made Religion</title>

      <description>One of the clear themes throughout the Bible is that it is God who defines how His creation must/should interact with Him. We are in no position (that is, we have no authority) to come to God on our own terms. If there is a God that is anything like the one described in the Bible, He has the inherit right, authority, and power to demand how we should relate to Him.</description>

      <title>Why you are Apathetic Toward Leviticus.</title>

      <description>Mistakes We often make two, critical mistakes when we read the book of Leviticus. First, we are to busy looking for imperatives and applications that we miss the meaning (and, therefore, the real applications). Second, we isolate Leviticus and don&amp;rsquo;t read it as part of a larger story. Let us begin with the first issue.
We, Christians who hold the Bible as the sole authority for life and Godliness, must stop reading the Bible selfishly.</description>

      <title>Passages for a Preliminary Understanding of the Plagues and the Exodus</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/israel-in-egypt/</link>

      <description>When we think about Israel&amp;rsquo;s time in Egypt, the plagues, and Israel&amp;rsquo;s Exodus from Egypt, there are a few passages that are important to keep in mind.
 Genesis 15:13-16 - Israel&amp;rsquo;s slavery in Egypt is promised as well as God&amp;rsquo;s judgement on Egypt and Israel&amp;rsquo;s subsequent possessions. Genesis 50:25-26 (and Exodus 23:19) - Joseph asks, with faith in God&amp;rsquo;s promise, that his bones be taken out of Egypt and buried in the land promised to Israel by God.</description>

      <title>Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</link>

      <guid>//bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</guid>
      <description>The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:
 Part of the reason some readers take issue with this passage is that they think Ham is getting off without punishment for his offense. The punishment that fell to Canaan, however, would have felt like a punishment to Ham as well. His line was not blessed and one of his sons was cursed.</description>

      <title>Satan or Serpent? Understanding the Protevangelium.</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</link>

      <description>I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way? This post contains my conclusion on the subject after thought and investigation.</description>

      <title>Please Pass the Pomegranate. Understanding the Nature of Sin in Genesis 3.</title>
      <link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/understanding-sin-from-genesis3/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Devil Made Me Do It&amp;rdquo;? First, consider who or what was involved in making Eve sin. One of the answers is clearly Satan in the form of the serpent (see Genesis 3:1). It is Satan who asks the infamous question &amp;ldquo;Hath God said&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and causes Eve to doubt the words of God. It is important to recognize, however, that Satan is not the only thing that drives Eve to sin.</description>
