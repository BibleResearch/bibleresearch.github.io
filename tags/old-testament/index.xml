I present the central argument followed by supporting evidence.
Deuteronomy as an Exposition of the Ten Commandments For most of Christian history, there has been discussion and debate about how Christians ought to make sense of the books of the Law. The central section of Deuteronomy (chapters 12 - 26), for example, has raised questions like: &amp;ldquo;Is there any order to these rules?</description></item><item><title>"For our sake also" - The Beauty and Grace of Divine Revelation</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/romans-4-23-and-24/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/romans-4-23-and-24/</guid><description>I was reading the book of Romans and Romans 4:23-25 jumped out at me; it reads:
&amp;ldquo;Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.</description></item><item><title>Guidelines for Using Old Testament Passages Well</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/guidelines-for-using-the-old-testament-well/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/guidelines-for-using-the-old-testament-well/</guid><description>Disclaimer Before reading the article below, I recommend you take a look at my post on Why I Cite Specific Examples. I address this issue humbly and with the utmost respect and love for all parties involved. None of us are perfect or perfectly consistent; it would not shock me if the whistle were blown on me for the same hermeneutic fouls I penalize below. I stand open to correction and am bold only because I believe that handling the Word of God is like donning a space-suit before going on a space walk; our very lives depend on it and it ought to be done with the greatest care and accuracy possible.</description></item><item><title>Pope Clement I on Salvation</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/first-pope-message/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/first-pope-message/</guid><description>Here is an excerpt from Pope Clement I in his First Epistle to the Corinthian Church:
&amp;ldquo;All these [referring to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob], therefore, were highly honoured, and made great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever.</description></item><item><title>Why Should I Read the Old Testament?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-read-ot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-read-ot/</guid><description>For the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer this question by looking at what the New Testament says about the Old Testament. So what does the New Testament have to say about the Old Testament?
The Old Testament&amp;hellip;
Predicts/points to Christ (Luke 24:44-47) Is sufficient to bring about salvation (Luke 16:19-31 (especially 29-31), 2 Timothy 3:15) Was written for our instruction (Romans 15:4, 1 Corinthians 10:11, Luke 17:32) Was written for our encouragement (Romans 15:4) (as part of scripture) Is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17) Is fulfilled in/by Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20)</description></item><item><title>The Performative Nature of Wisdom Literature</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</guid><description>Performative Wisdom Literature In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something. Language itself can do things. For example, saying &amp;ldquo;I now pronounce you husband and wife&amp;rdquo; in the proper context is not just a declarative statement about what I happen to be doing at the moment.</description></item><item><title>Psalm 62: God's Unique Ability to Save, Satisfy, and Sustain</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/psalm-62/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/psalm-62/</guid><description>Background According to the superscription, Psalm 62 is a psalm of David. While there is no explicit, historical context for the psalm, it refers to those who &amp;ldquo;assail a man that you may murder him&amp;rdquo; (Psalm 62:3). There were multiple points in David&amp;rsquo;s life when people were seeking to kill him, so this psalm could have been inspired by many of the events in David&amp;rsquo;s life.
Structure The psalm breaks down into five sections:</description></item><item><title>Cain &amp; Abel</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/cain-and-abel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/cain-and-abel/</guid><description>Genesis 4:1-15 describes the infamous story of Cain and Abel. In this story, two brothers, Cain (a &amp;ldquo;tiller of the ground&amp;rdquo;) and Abel (a &amp;ldquo;keeper of flocks&amp;rdquo;), bring a sacrifice before God (see Genesis 4:2-3). Verses three and four tell us that Cain brings &amp;ldquo;an offering of the fruit of the ground&amp;rdquo; and Abel brings &amp;ldquo;the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions&amp;rdquo;. The end of verse four and beginning of verse five reads: &amp;ldquo;And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard.</description></item><item><title>Psalm 90: The Problem of God's Immanence</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</guid><description>Before we begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
Sovereignty of God: God&amp;rsquo;s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.
If both of these attributes, as well as Holiness and Omniscience, are accurate descriptions of God&amp;rsquo;s character (and they are according to the testimony of Psalm 90 and scripture as a whole), then humans have a big problem; A God who is sovereign (in control), omniscient (knows everything a man does, thinks and feels), holy (separated and opposed to evil), and immanent (He relates with His creation) will produce a conundrum where God interacts and relates with His creation (due to His immanence) while killing them for their sin (because of His omniscience, sovereignty, and holiness).</description></item><item><title>The Spies' Bad Report</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/spies-bad-report/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/spies-bad-report/</guid><description>What is described below is, in my estimation, a well-supported conjecture, but a conjecture nonetheless. Consider it thoughtfully and critically.
I believe that Numbers 13:25-33 can be broken down as follows:
Numbers 13:25-26 - General summary of events. Spies return and give their report. Numbers 13:27-29 - This is said by the spies (particularly the ten spies who did not believe God) privately to Moses (at least not in the hearing of the people before Moses).</description></item><item><title>The Audacity of Man-made Religion</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/the-audacity-of-manmade-religion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/the-audacity-of-manmade-religion/</guid><description>One of the clear themes throughout the Bible is that it is God who defines how His creation must/should interact with Him. We are in no position (that is, we have no authority) to come to God on our own terms. If there is a God that is anything like the one described in the Bible, He has the inherit right, authority, and power to demand how we should relate to Him.</description></item><item><title>Why you are Apathetic Toward Leviticus</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/leviticus/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/leviticus/</guid><description>Mistakes We often make two, critical mistakes when we read the book of Leviticus. First, we are to busy looking for imperatives and applications that we miss the meaning (and, therefore, the real applications). Second, we isolate Leviticus and don&amp;rsquo;t read it as part of a larger story. Let us begin with the first issue.
We, Christians who hold the Bible as the sole authority for life and Godliness, must stop reading the Bible selfishly.</description></item><item><title>Passages for a Preliminary Understanding of the Plagues and the Exodus</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/israel-in-egypt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/israel-in-egypt/</guid><description>When we think about Israel&amp;rsquo;s time in Egypt, the plagues, and Israel&amp;rsquo;s Exodus from Egypt, there are a few passages that are important to keep in mind.
Genesis 15:13-16 - Israel&amp;rsquo;s slavery in Egypt is promised as well as God&amp;rsquo;s judgement on Egypt and Israel&amp;rsquo;s subsequent possessions. Genesis 50:25-26 (and Exodus 23:19) - Joseph asks, with faith in God&amp;rsquo;s promise, that his bones be taken out of Egypt and buried in the land promised to Israel by God.</description></item><item><title>Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</guid><description>The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:
Part of the reason some readers take issue with this passage is that they think Ham is getting off without punishment for his offense. The punishment that fell to Canaan, however, would have felt like a punishment to Ham as well. His line was not blessed and one of his sons was cursed.</description></item><item><title>Satan or Serpent? Understanding the Protevangelium.</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</guid><description>I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way? This post contains my conclusion on the subject after thought and investigation.</description></item><item><title>Please Pass the Pomegranate. Understanding the Nature of Sin in Genesis 3.</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/understanding-sin-from-genesis3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/understanding-sin-from-genesis3/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The Devil Made Me Do It&amp;rdquo;? First, consider who or what was involved in making Eve sin. One of the answers is clearly Satan in the form of the serpent (see Genesis 3:1). It is Satan who asks the infamous question &amp;ldquo;Hath God said&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and causes Eve to doubt the words of God. It is important to recognize, however, that Satan is not the only thing that drives Eve to sin.</description></item></channel></rss>
