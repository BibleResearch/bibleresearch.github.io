      <title>The Performative Nature of Wisdom Literature</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</link>

      <description>Wisdom literature in the Bible (books like Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes) is not easy to understand&amp;hellip; and this is no accident. It is designed not only to show you what true wisdom is, but also to produce it within you. This is what makes wisdom literature performative.
In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1 This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something.</description>

      <title>Psalm 62: God&#39;s Unique Ability to Save, Satisfy, and Sustain</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/psalm-62/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:8000/posts/psalm-62/</guid>
      <description>The record of human history demonstrates that God does three, wonderful things for mankind: He saves; He satisfies; He sustains. Psalm 62 celebrates these wonderful truths and emphasizes God&amp;rsquo;s unique ability to provide in each area.
Background According to the superscription, Psalm 62 is a psalm of David. While there is no explicit, historical context for the psalm, it refers to those who &amp;ldquo;assail a man that you may murder him&amp;rdquo; (Psalm 62:3).</description>

      <title>Cain &amp; Abel</title>

      <description>Why was Abel&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice accepted while Cain&amp;rsquo;s was not?
Genesis 4:1-15 describes the infamous story of Cain and Abel. In this story, two brothers, Cain (a &amp;ldquo;tiller of the ground&amp;rdquo;) and Abel (a &amp;ldquo;keeper of flocks&amp;rdquo;), bring a sacrifice before God (see Genesis 4:2-3). Verses three and four tell us that Cain brings &amp;ldquo;an offering of the fruit of the ground&amp;rdquo; and Abel brings &amp;ldquo;the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Psalm 90: The Problem of God&#39;s Immanence</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:8000/posts/sovereign-and-immanent-god/</guid>
      <description>Psalm 90 deals with one of the most basic challenges facing humanity: If there really is a sovereign, holy God who created everything and knows our every thought but is also immanent, how can man live and find meaning in living?
Before we begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
 Sovereignty of God: God&amp;rsquo;s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.</description>

      <title>The Spies&#39; Bad Report</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/spies-bad-report/</link>

      <description>In Numbers 13:25-33, the spies sent into the Promised Land return with a scouting report. There is some subtlety, however, to the way in which the report is described in the text that leads me to believe there is more to this account than is normally assumed. This post lays out what I believe to be the best understanding of the passage.
What is described below is, in my estimation, a well-supported theory, but a theory nonetheless.</description>

      <title>The Audacity of Man-made Religion</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/the-audacity-of-manmade-religion/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:8000/posts/the-audacity-of-manmade-religion/</guid>
      <description>Man-made religion is futile and abhorrent for a few reasons, but one, particular horror towers above the rest. Behind man-made religion is the arrogant declaration that we define the terms of our relationship with God. Thus, it is impossible for man-made religions to worship anything but man himself.
One of the clear themes throughout the Bible is that it is God who defines how His creation must/should interact with Him. We are in no position (that is, we have no authority) to come to God on our own terms.</description>

      <title>Why you are apathetic toward Leviticus.</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, Leviticus can be a hard book to read. It is probably the biggest killers of Bible reading plans. How can we get any value out of this book? In this post, I point out a couple mistakes we make when come to the book of Leviticus and suggest some ways to better understand and apply Leviticus.
Mistakes We often make two, critical mistakes when we read the book of Leviticus.</description>

      <title>Passages for a Preliminary Understanding of the Plagues and the Exodus</title>

      <description>When we think about Israel&amp;rsquo;s time in Egypt, the plagues, and Israel&amp;rsquo;s Exodus from Egypt, there are a few passages that are important to keep in mind.
 Genesis 15:13-16 - Israel&amp;rsquo;s slavery in Egypt is promised as well as God&amp;rsquo;s judgement on Egypt and Israel&amp;rsquo;s subsequent possessions. Genesis 50:25-26 (and Exodus 23:19) - Joseph asks, with faith in God&amp;rsquo;s promise, that his bones be taken out of Egypt and buried in the land promised to Israel by God.</description>

      <title>Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?</title>
      <link>//localhost:8000/posts/canaan-and-ham/</link>

      <description>Characteristic of the strange stories in Genesis, the story of Shem, Ham (and Canaan), and Japheth in Genesis 9:18-27 is the subject of much debate. Of particular interest is this: Why does Noah curse Canaan (Ham&amp;rsquo;s son) if Ham was the one who perpetrated the crime in question?
The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:</description>

      <title>Satan or Serpent? Understanding the Protevangelium.</title>

      <description>Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 as applying to Satan?
I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way?</description>

      <title>Please Pass the Pomegranate. Understanding the Nature of Sin in Genesis 3.</title>

      <description>Just three short chapters into the narrative of God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive plan, we find Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, clothed with fig leaves and damning themselves and their children to a life separated from God. There are two observations about the story in Genesis 3 that I wish to make which will help us better understand the nature of sin.
First, consider who or what was involved in making Eve sin.</description>
