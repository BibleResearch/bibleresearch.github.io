I know 1 John discusses what is looks like to be a Christian and how we can know we are saved (for example, 1 John 5:13). I want to &amp;ldquo;know that [I] have eternal life&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m having a hard time reconciling the claims of assurance in 1 John with some other truths from scripture.</description></item></channel></rss>
