Understanding the Protevangelium.</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</guid><description>I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way? This post contains my conclusion on the subject after thought and investigation.</description></item></channel></rss>
