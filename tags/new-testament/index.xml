We had just discussed John 18:3 where the word &amp;ldquo;σπεῖραν&amp;rdquo;1could mean either a tenth of a legion (a legion was 6,000 men, so this would mean 600 men were coming to arrest Jesus) or used as Polybius referring to 200 men2. Either way, you likely have a good number of men coming to arrest Jesus.</description></item><item><title>Fighting Sin by Serving</title><link>//bible.hightower.space/posts/fight-sin-by-serving/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>//bible.hightower.space/posts/fight-sin-by-serving/</guid><description>I was reading Galatians 5:13 recently and this jumped out at me:
For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
In our efforts to glorify God and fight sin, one helpful strategy that I pull from this verse is to be busy serving one another. This has the dual benefits of keeping you busy and focusing your efforts on serving Christ and His church.</description></item></channel></rss>
