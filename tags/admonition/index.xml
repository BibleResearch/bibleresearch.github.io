      <description>You only have one, short life. What is the most valuable thing you can do with it?
I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but one of my greatest fears is wasting my life. Getting to 60 years of age and realizing, with a hollow, sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything with my life.
The problem for many, myself included, is knowing what is the most valuable thing we can be doing.</description>

      <description>This week, take some time to thank a teacher or mentor you appreciate.
All it takes is a quick email, phone call, or even a text. Or better yet&amp;hellip; next time you see them, take some time to let them know how much you appreciate what they do for you. It is really hard to be a teacher and is often a thank-less endeavour which can get depressing over time. Even a short word of thanks can go great lengths to encourage your teacher.</description>

      <description>We are living in what is quickly becoming a post-Christian culture. As such, pastors, teachers, leaders, and even lay Christians need to wake up to the reality that Christian jargon widely understood in previous generations is no longer understood by the vast majority of people under the age of 30.
Examples Last time communion was served at my Church, I heard the familiar phrase: &amp;ldquo;If you are not a believer, please let the elements pass you by&amp;rdquo;.</description>
