We had just discussed John 18:3 where the word &amp;ldquo;σπεῖραν&amp;rdquo;1could mean either a tenth of a legion (a legion was 6,000 men, so this would mean 600 men were coming to arrest Jesus) or used as Polybius referring to 200 men2. Either way, you likely have a good number of men coming to arrest Jesus.</description></item></channel></rss>
