People are so important! 1 Peter has been one of the defining books in my life recently. I have gleaned so many treasures from this little book and, although I am constantly unearthing new and beautiful truths, it is hard for me to think of any book as being more applicable to believers today than 1 Peter. I especially love the end of chapter 1 where Peter encourages us to fervently love one another (1 Peter 1:22) because we are of imperishable seed (1 Peter 1:23-25) and, just like the imperishable word of God (1 Peter 1:24-25), believers are also of this imperishable nature.</description></item></channel></rss>
