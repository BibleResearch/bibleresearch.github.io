I would like to challenge you with Jesus' words on forgiveness. Jesus is not flippant or trivial on the topic of forgiveness and he attributes a weight and significance to forgiveness that is, I think, often lessened. I hope you will consider the practical implications of Jesus' words for your own life. In the words of Paul: Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.</description></item><item><title>Was Satan Suprised?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/was-satan-suprised/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/was-satan-suprised/</guid><description>Was Satan surprised&amp;hellip; too busy looking at Job to see Jesus?
too busy deceiving the eves to notice the ave&amp;hellip; maria who, through no merit of her own and though a sinner such as I, was blessed to bring into the fallen, dirty world one who, in ages past, had made the oceans whirl and rivers swirl?
Was Satan surprised&amp;hellip; too busy roaming about on the earth?
too busy building Babel to notice a babe in Bethlehem&amp;hellip; who, by submission to His Fatherâ€™s will and because of His great love with which He loved us, would bless sinners with reconciliation and an inheritance?</description></item></channel></rss>
