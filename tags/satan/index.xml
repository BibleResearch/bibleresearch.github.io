While the pastor did not say what I am about to say explicitly, he hinted in its general direction and I am very grateful not just for this sermon, but also for his faithful ministry of the word of God.</description></item><item><title>Satan or Serpent?

It is Satan who asks the infamous question &amp;ldquo;Hath God said&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and causes Eve to doubt the words of God.

too busy deceiving the eves to notice the ave&amp;hellip; maria who, through no merit of her own and though a sinner such as I, was blessed to bring into the fallen, dirty world one who, in ages past, had made the oceans whirl and rivers swirl?
Was Satan surprised&amp;hellip; too busy roaming about on the earth?
too busy building Babel to notice a babe in Bethlehem&amp;hellip; who, by submission to His Fatherâ€™s will and because of His great love with which He loved us, would bless sinners with reconciliation and an inheritance?</description></item></channel></rss>
