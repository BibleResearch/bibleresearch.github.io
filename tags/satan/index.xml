      <description>Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 as applying to Satan?
I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way?</description>

      <description>Just three short chapters into the narrative of God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive plan, we find Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, clothed with fig leaves and damning themselves and their children to a life separated from God. There are two observations about the story in Genesis 3 that I wish to make which will help us better understand the nature of sin.
First, consider who or what was involved in making Eve sin.</description>
