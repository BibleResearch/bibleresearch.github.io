      <description>What is Prayer? The most basic and robust definition I can muster is:
 Prayer is talking to God.
 I would like to break this phrase down to better explain myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the phrase &amp;ldquo;talking to&amp;rdquo;.
The phrase &amp;ldquo;talking to&amp;rdquo; is important for at least two reasons. First, prayer in the Bible is often done by speaking out loud to God. For example, Jesus in John 17:1 &amp;ldquo;spoke these things; and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (emphasis added).</description>

      <description>Genesis 4:1-15 describes the infamous story of Cain and Abel. In this story, two brothers, Cain (a &amp;ldquo;tiller of the ground&amp;rdquo;) and Abel (a &amp;ldquo;keeper of flocks&amp;rdquo;), bring a sacrifice before God (see Genesis 4:2-3). Verses three and four tell us that Cain brings &amp;ldquo;an offering of the fruit of the ground&amp;rdquo; and Abel brings &amp;ldquo;the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions&amp;rdquo;. The end of verse four and beginning of verse five reads: &amp;ldquo;And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard.</description>

      <title>Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?</title>

      <description>The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:
 Part of the reason some readers take issue with this passage is that they think Ham is getting off without punishment for his offense. The punishment that fell to Canaan, however, would have felt like a punishment to Ham as well. His line was not blessed and one of his sons was cursed.</description>

      <title>Satan or Serpent? Understanding the Protevangelium.</title>

      <description>I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way? This post contains my conclusion on the subject after thought and investigation.</description>

      <title>Blog Objectives</title>

      <description>The basic objective of this blog is to give me a platform to communicate some of the thoughts and observations I have that don&amp;rsquo;t fit well into the Bible Notes project. My goal in voicing some of these thoughts is to provide more resources that will strengthen the Church and produce mature, thoughtful followers of Christ. It also gives me the chance to hone my writing and communication skills (which I then hope to use to strengthen the Church).</description>
