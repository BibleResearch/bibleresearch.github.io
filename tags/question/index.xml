If you choose to keep reading, please skim this post first: https://bible.hightower.space/posts/2020-warning/.
What must I do to be saved?
Seriously, what must I do to be saved? I&amp;rsquo;m so confused and overwhelmed by a whirl-wind of comments and responses on this question (both from inside and outside the Bible) that I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what the answer is right now.</description></item><item><title>What Makes an Action Glorifying to God?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/what-makes-an-action-glorifying-to-god/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/what-makes-an-action-glorifying-to-god/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The modern Western church tends to be overly pietistic. This often manifests in an attitude that says “if you really want to do God’s work, then be a missionary or a pastor.” Pursuant to this view, everyone else is a sort of second-class spiritual citizen, not really doing things that matter all that much for the Kingdom. The implicit message that comes through many times even in evangelical preaching is that if you are one of these second-class spiritual citizens, i.</description></item><item><title>Does Every Word in the Bible Only Have One Meaning?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/words-only-one-meaning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/words-only-one-meaning/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that words and sentences can have but one signification in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture. It is commonly assumed by the universal sense of mankind that unless one designedly put forth a riddle, he will so speak as to convey his meaning as clearly as possible to others.</description></item><item><title>Questions about Exegetical Preaching</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/questions-about-exegetical-preaching/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/questions-about-exegetical-preaching/</guid><description>The subsequent blog post captures a few of my questions about exegetical preaching; at the time of writing, these are open questions and I do not have answers to them. I articulate these questions with the intention of getting them answered. If/when I get them answered, I will write another post providing the answers and will post it here.
I write this with the utmost respect for all, gospel-preaching pastors. I am in no way attempting to insult or undermine their work.</description></item><item><title>Dealing with Doubts</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/dealing-with-doubts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/dealing-with-doubts/</guid><description>Here are some practical principles I have come up with:
Don&amp;rsquo;t wallow in doubt Don&amp;rsquo;t stay isolated (and don&amp;rsquo;t isolate yourself) With respect to God&amp;rsquo;s word, be (James 1): quick to listen slow to speak slow to become angry Pray like crazy! - Follow the example of David, James 1, Jesus, and the Apostles (see also some thoughts on prayerlessness) Trust God&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty Address the issues head-on When in doubt, trust the boundaries and means of Grace God has given No friendly-fire!</description></item><item><title>Why Should I Read the Old Testament?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-read-ot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-read-ot/</guid><description>For the time being, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer this question by looking at what the New Testament says about the Old Testament. So what does the New Testament have to say about the Old Testament?
The Old Testament&amp;hellip;
Predicts/points to Christ (Luke 24:44-47) Is sufficient to bring about salvation (Luke 16:19-31 (especially 29-31), 2 Timothy 3:15) Was written for our instruction (Romans 15:4, 1 Corinthians 10:11, Luke 17:32) Was written for our encouragement (Romans 15:4) (as part of scripture) Is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17) Is fulfilled in/by Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20)</description></item><item><title>Why Should We Pray?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-pray/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 05:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/why-pray/</guid><description>Reasons to Pray Scripture gives numerous reasons why we should pray. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at a few examples. I&amp;rsquo;m going to split the reasons why we should pray into two categories:
We should pray in order to:
Glorify God Enjoy Him forever This way of breaking these reasons down is based on the first question and answer of the Westminster Confession of Faith.
&amp;ldquo;to glorify God&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; We should pray because prayer glorifies God.</description></item><item><title>What Is Prayer?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/what-is-prayer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 05:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/what-is-prayer/</guid><description>[P]rayer is a retirement from earth and a retreat from our fellow creatures to fix our attention on God and communicate with Him who dwells in heaven.
~ Isaac Watts - A Guide to Prayer
What is Prayer? The most basic and robust definition I can think of is:
Prayer is talking to God.1 I would like to break this phrase down to better explain myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the phrase &amp;ldquo;talking to&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Cain &amp; Abel</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/cain-and-abel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/cain-and-abel/</guid><description>Genesis 4:1-15 describes the infamous story of Cain and Abel. In this story, two brothers, Cain (a &amp;ldquo;tiller of the ground&amp;rdquo;) and Abel (a &amp;ldquo;keeper of flocks&amp;rdquo;), bring a sacrifice before God (see Genesis 4:2-3). Verses three and four tell us that Cain brings &amp;ldquo;an offering of the fruit of the ground&amp;rdquo; and Abel brings &amp;ldquo;the firstlings of his flock and their fat portions&amp;rdquo;. The end of verse four and beginning of verse five reads: &amp;ldquo;And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard.</description></item><item><title>Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/canaan-and-ham/</guid><description>The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:
Part of the reason some readers take issue with this passage is that they think Ham is getting off without punishment for his offense. The punishment that fell to Canaan, however, would have felt like a punishment to Ham as well. His line was not blessed and one of his sons was cursed.</description></item><item><title>Satan or Serpent? Understanding the Protevangelium.</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/defending-protevangelium/</guid><description>I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual &amp;lsquo;serpent&amp;rsquo; (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way? This post contains my conclusion on the subject after thought and investigation.</description></item><item><title>Blog Objectives</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/blog-objectives/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/blog-objectives/</guid><description>The basic objective of this blog is to give me a platform to communicate some of the thoughts and observations I have that don&amp;rsquo;t fit well into the Bible Notes project. My goal in voicing some of these thoughts is to provide more resources that will strengthen the Church and produce mature, thoughtful followers of Christ. It also gives me the chance to hone my writing and communication skills (which I then hope to use to strengthen the Church).</description></item></channel></rss>
