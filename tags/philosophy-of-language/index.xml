While I do not deny defending my presuppositions would be a useful endeavor, I am not going to undertake it here.</description></item><item><title>The Performative Nature of Wisdom Literature</title><link>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 06:21:22 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://bible.hightower.space/posts/performative-wisdom-lit/</guid><description>Performative Wisdom Literature In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something. Language itself can do things. For example, saying &amp;ldquo;I now pronounce you husband and wife&amp;rdquo; in the proper context is not just a declarative statement about what I happen to be doing at the moment.</description></item></channel></rss>
