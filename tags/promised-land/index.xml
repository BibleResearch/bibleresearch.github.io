      <description>What is described below is, in my estimation, a well-supported conjecture, but a conjecture nonetheless. Consider it thoughtfully and critically.
I believe that Numbers 13:25-33 can be broken down as follows:
 Numbers 13:25-26 - General summary of events. Spies return and give their report. Numbers 13:27-29 - This is said by the spies (particularly the ten spies who did not believe God) privately to Moses (at least not in the hearing of the people before Moses).</description>
