      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m laying out a system I use to help me pray for other people and requests consistently over time while not getting bored because I&amp;rsquo;m praying for the same thing or getting frustrated because I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to pray for. I use it as a system for guiding my prayer life and I hope you find it helpful. Feel free to tweak and modify it as you see fit.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a series called Practical Spiritual Disciplines in which I will be discussing how to practice the spiritual disciplines. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to discuss how we can make prayer a regular part of our lives.
The Question We all know prayer is important. Prayer is one of the most common topics throughout the Bible and Jesus Himself consistently made time out of His busy and effective ministry to pray (see Luke 5:16, 6:12, 9:28, 11:1, and 22:41 as some examples).</description>
