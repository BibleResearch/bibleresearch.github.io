title: Why is Canaan Cursed Rather than Ham?
author: Floyd Hightower

Characteristic of the strange stories in Genesis, the story of Shem, Ham (and Canaan), and Japheth in Genesis 9:18-27 has been the subject of much debate. Of particular interest is this: Why does Noah curse Canaan (Ham's son) if Ham was the one who perpetrated the crime in question?

While we are not told exactly why Canaan is cursed in the text, I believe there are a few things we can safely assume:

1. The punishment that fell to Canaan would have like a punishment to Ham as well. In other words, when Canaan is cursed by Noah, it is not as though Ham breathed a sigh of relief as though he had gotten away with his offense.
2. It is not unreasonable to assume that Canaan was involved in or at least had the same attitude as Ham. If this is the case, the punishment should not be viewed as arbitrarily vindicative, but a just focusing of punishment on the guilty parties while excluding Ham's other children (see Genesis 10:6). It is also possible that Noah had some prophetic revelation by which he knew of the immorality that would come from Canaan.

We do not have the details in Scripture to say definitively what went on in this story, but I do think the two points I have laid out above form a reasonable conjecture that Noah knew Canaan was following in the footsteps of Ham and decides to curse Canaan and exclude Ham's other sons from the punishment.
