                            <h2>In Numbers 13:25-33, the spies sent into the Promised Land return with a scouting report. There is some subtlety, however, to the way in which the report is described in the text that leads me to believe there is more to this account than is normally assumed. This post lays out what I believe to be the best understanding of the passage.
What is described below is, in my estimation, a well-supported theory, but a theory nonetheless.</h2>

                            <h2>Man-made religion is futile and abhorrent for a few reasons, but one, particular horror towers above the rest. Behind man-made religion is the arrogant declaration that we define the terms of our relationship with God. Thus, it is impossible for man-made religions to worship anything but man himself.
One of the clear themes throughout the Bible is that it is God who defines how His creation must/should interact with Him. We are in no position (that is, we have no authority) to come to God on our own terms.</h2>

                            <h2>Let’s face it, Leviticus can be a hard book to read. It is probably the biggest killers of Bible reading plans. How can we get any value out of this book? In this post, I point out a couple mistakes we make when come to the book of Leviticus and suggest some ways to better understand and apply Leviticus.
Mistakes We often make two, critical mistakes when we read the book of Leviticus.</h2>

                            <h2>Many protestants are very familiar with the five ‘solas’ of the Reformation, but do you understand how they relate with one another?
The principles behind the reformation are often summarized in five exclusive statements deemed ‘Solae’ or ‘Solas’:
 Sola Scriptura (“Scripture alone”) Sola Fide (“faith alone”) Sola Gratia (“grace alone”) Solus Christus (“Christ alone”) Soli Deo gloria (“glory to God alone”)  These statements have been used both to describe what Luther and the other reformers believed as well as to discern what the Bible does and does not teach.</h2>

                            <h2>When we think about Israel’s time in Egypt, the plagues, and Israel’s Exodus from Egypt, there are a few passages that are important to keep in mind.
 Genesis 15:13-16 - Israel’s slavery in Egypt is promised as well as God’s judgement on Egypt and Israel’s subsequent possessions. Genesis 50:25-26 (and Exodus 23:19) - Joseph asks, with faith in God’s promise, that his bones be taken out of Egypt and buried in the land promised to Israel by God.</h2>

Of particular interest is this: Why does Noah curse Canaan (Ham’s son) if Ham was the one who perpetrated the crime in question?
The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:</h2>

I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual ‘serpent’ (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way?</h2>

The basic objective of this blog is to give me a platform to communicate some of the thoughts and observations I have that don’t fit well into the Bible Notes project. My goal in voicing some of these thoughts is to provide more resources that will strengthen the Church and produce mature, thoughtful followers of Christ. It also gives me the chance to hone my writing and communication skills (which I then hope to use to strengthen the Church).</h2>
