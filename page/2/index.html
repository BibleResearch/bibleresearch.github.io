                            <h2>Many protestants are very familiar with the five ‘solas’ of the Reformation, but do you understand how they relate with one another?
The principles behind the reformation are often summarized in five exclusive statements deemed ‘Solae’ or ‘Solas’:
 Sola Scriptura (“Scripture alone”) Sola Fide (“faith alone”) Sola Gratia (“grace alone”) Solus Christus (“Christ alone”) Soli Deo gloria (“glory to God alone”)  These statements have been used both to describe what Luther and the other reformers believed as well as to discern what the Bible does and does not teach.</h2>

                            <h2>When we think about Israel’s time in Egypt, the plagues, and Israel’s Exodus from Egypt, there are a few passages that are important to keep in mind.
 Genesis 15:13-16 - Israel’s slavery in Egypt is promised as well as God’s judgement on Egypt and Israel’s subsequent possessions. Genesis 50:25-26 (and Exodus 23:19) - Joseph asks, with faith in God’s promise, that his bones be taken out of Egypt and buried in the land promised to Israel by God.</h2>

                            <h2>Characteristic of the strange stories in Genesis, the story of Shem, Ham (and Canaan), and Japheth in Genesis 9:18-27 is the subject of much debate. Of particular interest is this: Why does Noah curse Canaan (Ham’s son) if Ham was the one who perpetrated the crime in question?
The text does not give us enough details to know exactly why, but I think there are a few things we can conclude from the passage:</h2>

                            <h2>We are living in what is quickly becoming a post-Christian culture. As such, pastors, teachers, leaders, and even lay Christians need to wake up to the reality that Christian jargon widely understood in previous generations is no longer understood by the vast majority of people under the age of 30.
Examples Last time communion was served at my Church, I heard the familiar phrase: “If you are not a believer, please let the elements pass you by”.</h2>

I was recently reading through Genesis and paused when I got to Genesis 3:14-15. I have always been taught that Genesis 3:15 was directed not at the physical serpent (that is, the creature itself), but the spiritual ‘serpent’ (who is Satan). But in my recent reading, I asked myself: Are we right to interpret Genesis 3:15 in this way?</h2>

The basic objective of this blog is to give me a platform to communicate some of the thoughts and observations I have that don’t fit well into the Bible Notes project. My goal in voicing some of these thoughts is to provide more resources that will strengthen the Church and produce mature, thoughtful followers of Christ. It also gives me the chance to hone my writing and communication skills (which I then hope to use to strengthen the Church).</h2>
