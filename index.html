The Question We all know prayer is important. Prayer is one of the most common topics throughout the Bible and Jesus Himself consistently made time out of His busy and effective ministry to pray (see Luke 5:16, 6:12, 9:28, 11:1, and 22:41 as some examples).</h2>

This post is designed to discuss what I mean by a “spiritual discipline” and to look at some of the spiritual disciplines presented in the Bible.

Motivation In Western, conservative Churches, our knowledge often far exceeds our living. That is, we usually know far more about theology than we live out in our lives. When it comes down to it, most of us know what we are supposed to do (for example: pray, read your Bible, evangelize, etc.</h2>

                            <h2>Wisdom literature in the Bible (books like Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes) is not easy to understand… and this is no accident. It is designed not only to show you what true wisdom is, but also to produce it within you. This is what makes wisdom literature performative.
In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1 This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something.</h2>

All it takes is a quick email, phone call, or even a text. Or better yet… next time you see them, take some time to let them know how much you appreciate what they do for you. It is really hard to be a teacher and is often a thank-less endeavour which can get depressing over time.

Before we begin, let’s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
 Sovereignty of God: God’s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.</h2>
