                    Practical Spiritual Disciplines: What are Spiritual Disciplines?
                    
                        
                            <h2>I’m starting a series called “Practical Spiritual Disciplines” (there is an introduction here) in which I will be discussing how to practice the spiritual disciplines. Before I do this, however, I figured I had better define what I mean by a “spiritual discipline” and that is the subject of this post.
Definition A spiritual discipline is an activity, which ought to be a habit, that the Bible prescribes for Christians to help them grow spiritually.</h2>

                            <h2>This is the introduction to a series which gives practical steps for practicing the “spiritual disciplines” (activities like prayer, reading your Bible, serving the Church, etc). In this post, I lay out the motivation and objectives for this series.
Motivation In Western, conservative Churches, our knowledge often far exceeds our living. That is, we usually know far more about theology than we live out in our lives. When it comes down to it, most of us know what we are supposed to do (for example: pray, read your Bible, evangelize, etc.</h2>

                            <h2>Wisdom literature in the Bible (books like Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes) is not easy to understand… and this is no accident. It is designed not only to show you what true wisdom is, but also to produce it within you. This is what makes wisdom literature performative.
In linguistics, performativity describes of the ability of communication (in any form) to do something.1 This is a break from the way we normally view language as a means of describing something or asking someone to do something.</h2>

                            <h2>The record of human history demonstrates that God does three, wonderful things for mankind: He saves; He satisfies; He sustains. Psalm 62 celebrates these wonderful truths and emphasizes God’s unique ability to provide in each area.
Background According to the superscription, Psalm 62 is a psalm of David. While there is no explicit, historical context for the psalm, it refers to those who “assail a man that you may murder him” (Psalm 62:3).</h2>

                            <h2>Psalm 90 deals with one of the most basic challenges facing humanity: If there really is a sovereign, holy God who created everything and knows our every thought but is also immanent, how can man live and find meaning in living?
Before we begin, let’s define some of the terms with which we may not be familiar:
 Sovereignty of God: God’s absolute control and rule over everything.
Immanence of God: The tendency of God to relate with His creation and interact in human history.</h2>

                            <h2>Man-made religion is futile and abhorrent for a few reasons, but one, particular horror towers above the rest. Behind man-made religion is the arrogant declaration that we define the terms of our relationship with God. Thus, it is impossible for man-made religions to worship anything but man himself.
One of the clear themes throughout the Bible is that it is God who defines how His creation must/should interact with Him. We are in no position (that is, we have no authority) to come to God on our own terms.</h2>
