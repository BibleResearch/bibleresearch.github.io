This is part of a series called [Practical Spiritual Disciplines](../practical-spiritual-disciplines-why) in which I will be discussing *how* to practice the spiritual disciplines.

# The Questions

The Bible is often called "God's word", but have you stopped to think about what this means? If the Bible contains the divinely inspired words of God as it claims (2 Timothy 3:14-16, 2 Peter 1:16-21), *How can we make Bible study a regular part of our lives?*. Once we have done this, *How do we read the Bible well?*. That is, *What should we be looking for in the Bible and how should we interpret it accurately and faithfully?*. 

# Making Prayer a Habit

Here are some tips I recommend for making prayer a habit:

1. **Find a time.** Try to find a consistent time everyday when you can pray. Maybe it is over a lunch break, perhaps on the drive to work, maybe in between classes. Having a specific time when you pray will help you build a new habit
2. **Stay committed.** There is nothing magical about the spiritual disciplines... just as it takes time to grow physically, it also takes time to grow spiritually. I often see people give up after one or two weeks, but you need to persevere in order to grow. Do whatever it takes to help you make your prayer life a priority and a commitment.
3. **Develop a plan.** When it comes to prayer, here is a big challenge: how do you consistently pray for requests that you have while not getting bored in praying for the same thing over and over again? I have developed a system for praying that I find helpful as it allows you to consistently pray for people while not getting bored because you're praying for the same things over and over. You can read more about this plan [here](../prayer-plan). Feel free to adjust this system as you see fit.

# What to Say When You Pray

So you've started praying regularly... but what do you say when you pray? Jesus's disciples asked Him the same exact question in Luke 11:1-13. Jesus responds with what we know as "The Lord's Prayer". There is a parallel passage where Jesus teaches the same thing in Matthew 6:9-13. We'll look at the passage in Matthew 6:9-13 because this is a great model for our prayers. I would break down Jesus's prayer in Matthew 6:9-13 as follows:

  > Worshiping God (vs. 9-10)
  > 
  >  > For who He is (9)
  >  > 
  >  > For what He will do (10)
  > 
  > Prayer for our needs (vs. 11-13)
  > 
  >  > Physical needs (11)
  >  > 
  >  > Spiritual needs (12-13)

Think about how we normally pray. W spend the majority of our time praying for physical needs (and sometimes spiritual needs). Both physical and spiritual needs are part of Jesus' prayer, but we often forget the first half of the Lord's prayer that begins in worship to God. When you pray, I encourage you to start out by worshiping and thanking God for who He is and what He has promised to do. This is Biblical and it will transform prayer from a dry recitation of requests into a rich time of worship and communion with God.
