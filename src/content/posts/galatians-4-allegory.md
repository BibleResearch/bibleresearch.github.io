# Question

In Galatians 4:21-31, is Paul interpreting the Old Testament allegorically? He certainly appears to be doing so based on 4:24.

This is a significant question because it provides a glimpse into Paul's hermeneutics. A broader question would be: Did Paul support an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament?

# Background

## Galatians 4:24

The difficult verse is Galatians 4:24 which, in the NASB, is translated:

> "This is allegorically speaking, for these *women* are two covenants: one *proceeding* from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar."

The challenging word in this verse is "allegorically" because a historical-grammatical method of interpretation used by most protestants holds that there are very few, if any, allegories in the Bible.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

## Defining Allegory

An allegory is a literary device in which the author/artist communicates meaning on a symbolic level in addition to or rather than a literary level.<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> That is, in an allegory the literary elements and characters stand for some veiled, symbolic meaning. The meaning of an allegory cannot be found in the text itself; it is hidden and can only be found when the symbolic representations of the characters and plot elements of the text are properly interpreted.

# Answer

Is Paul interpreting the Old Testament allegorically in Galatians 4:24? The Greek word which is usually translated as "allegory" in Galatians 4:24 is "ἀλληγορέω". This breaks down into two components "ἀλλη" and "γορέω":

- "ἄλλος": another
- "ἀγορεύω": to speak, to speak publicly

The word "ἀλληγορέω" could be translated: "to speak of another thing", "to speak of one thing by way of another", or "to speak of one thing by referring to another".<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>

Given this meaning of the Greek word "ἀλληγορέω", "Paul is not giving an allegory, he’s giving an illustration".<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup> Galatians 4:24 could be translated something like:

> This is communicating one thing by referring to another, for these women are two covenants...

Thus, Paul is not interpreting the Old Testament as a true allegory; he is using it as an illustration. Paul's hermeneutics in this passage do not militate against a historical-grammatical interpretation of scripture and do not suggest that the Old Testament should be interpreted allegorically.

There is a very helpful treatment of Galatians 4:24 here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_WIZ1UijPU&t=0h15m16s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_WIZ1UijPU&t=0h15m16s).
