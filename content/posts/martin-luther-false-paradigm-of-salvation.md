This is part of a series on [salvation](https://bible.hightower.space/tags/salvation/) and how men can be saved.

# Preface and Warning

By way of preface, I would like to voice some warnings (which you can [skip](#did-martin-luther-teach-a-false-paradigm-of-salvation) at your own risk):

**First**, I'm confused. If you're looking for what the Bible says about how sinful man can be reconciled to a Holy God, this is not a blog post that will answer that question and I sincerely ask you to stop reading.

**Second**, asking questions like the ones that follow make me feel like a child wading into the Pacific Ocean with the intention of swimming across it. I proceed with such apparent foolishness for three reasons:

1. I firmly believe God is so magnificent and glorious that it would be better to sink quietly into unfathomable depths, lungs filled with suffocating saltwater, having caught a glimpse of glory than to spend a long, leisurely life safely on the shore without a glimmer of God.
2. I do not think I can continue to live an intellectually vital and honest life without addressing these questions. I cannot ignore them and pursue a vital intellect; I cannot settle for partial, unsatisfying answers and have an honest intellect. No matter how inadequate I feel in this endevour, I must fight to achieve the prize or die in the attempt. It simply must be done.
3. I proceed to, as it were, swim across the Pacific because I hope, as millennias of men have testified, that there is a gracious, triune God able to rescue those drowning in the depths of His word and character. We must never forget that theological questions are an attempt to sketch out the dimensions of realities now obscure to us. Theology has an object... and that object is living, powerful, and awesome! We must never be so foolish as to read the Bible and forget that the same God who inspired these words still lives. He is not dead! I swim because it's worth it. I swim because I must. I swim knowing that there is a gracious triune God who is able to deliver, but, even if He does not, I will still hope in Him.

**Third**, do not assume I know what I'm talking about; please validate my claims. If what I'm saying does not make sense to you, please [let me know](https://hightower.space/contact/). I feel my biblical knowledge is, if translated to physical dimensions, about the size of a child; my theological knowledge about the size of a house-cat; my knowledge of church history akin to an ant. So be warned; I am not an expert on any of the topics I discuss or mention below.

With all that said by way of warning, I now proceed to my question.

# Did Martin Luther Teach a False Paradigm of Salvation?

I believe that the logical implications of what is taught in some conservative, evangelical churches necessarily leads us to the conclusion that Martin Luther, the revered reformer whose face likely appears on posters in such churches and whose slogans and statements are regularly quoted, taught a false paradigm of salvation. That is, Martin Luther is a false teacher. He taught a falsehood on one of the most important issues in the Bible (salvation) which qualifies him as a false teacher with the Roman Catholic Church.<sup>1</sup>

My conclusion proceeds from the following tenets which are held and promulgated by many conservative, evangelical churches with which I am familiar.

<aside class="marginnote">
  <span class="noteNumber">1</span> - To be clear, I do not, necessarily, agree with this argument. I'm simply saying that this argument is implied in the logic of many churches.
</aside>

In simple form, the logical structure of the argument is:

1. "A" teaches "x" as a paradigm of salvation.
2. "x" is false.
3. Conclusion from 1 and 2: "A" teaches a false paradigm of salvation.
4. "B" also teaches "x" (or at least something very similar to "x") as a paradigm of salvation.
5. Conclusion from 2 and 4: "B" teaches a false paradigm of salvation.

For those interested in programming, prolog, and/or satisfiability modulo theory solvers, you can validate the logical structure of this argument with the Python or Prolog code here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/fhightower/d9cc7e7e2c7dc4898edf52695c117a14" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/fhightower/d9cc7e7e2c7dc4898edf52695c117a14</a>.

In longer form, the argument goes:

1. The Roman Catholic Church teaches the following on baptism as a necessity for salvation:

    > "The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation. He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to baptize them. Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament. The Church does not know of any means other than Baptism that assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are "reborn of water and the Spirit." God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments."<sup>2</sup>

2. The Roman Catholic Church's teaching on baptism is wrong because it "teaches its adherents to trust in the things that they do in order to eventually achieve salvation" which is contrary to Ephesians 2:8-9.<sup>3</sup>

    </aside>

3. Therefore (concluded from premise 1 and 2): the Roman Catholic Church teaches a false paradigm of salvation.
4. Martin Luther (*after* his departure from the Roman Church) held a view on baptism that is similar to the Roman Catholic Church. This is evidenced by his *[Small Catechism](https://catechism.cph.org/en/sacrament-of-holy-baptism.html)* where he says:

    > "What benefits does Baptism give?
    > 
    > It works forgiveness of sins, rescues from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare."<sup>4</sup>

5. Therefore (concluding from premise 2 and 4): Martin Luther taught a false paradigm of salvation.

  <span class="noteNumber">4</span> - <a href="https://catechism.cph.org/en/sacrament-of-holy-baptism.html" target="_blank">https://catechism.cph.org/en/sacrament-of-holy-baptism.html</a>
</aside>

To be clear, I do not, necessarily, believe the conclusion above and you should not believe it on grounds of my argument alone. I'm simply making implied conclusions explicit. It seems that the facts, interpretations, and logic above prove many conservative, evangelical churches believe that Martin Luther taught a false paradigm of salvation; that is, Martin Luther is a false teacher along with the Roman Catholic Church. Is my logic wrong? Are my facts and/or interpretation of those facts wrong?

If my facts, logic, and interpretations hold, what are the implications of the conclusion that Martin Luther taught a false paradigm of salvation? Many conservative, evangelical churches put Martin Luther's face on posters celebrating the reformation and might as well have "Sola Fide" tattooed across the foreheads of every member<sup>5</sup>. The problem is, it seems that Martin Luther meant something very different when he said "Sola Fide" that how we interpret it.

<aside class="marginnote">
  <p><span class="noteNumber">5</span> - When I say that "Sola Fide" may as well be tattooed on the foreheads of every congregant, I mean that, in my experience, the slogan "Sola Fide" is <i>very</i> commonly used to describe the conservative, evangelical paradigm of salvation.</p>
  <p><span class="noteNumber">6</span> - Particularly, this reasoning seems to imply that many Anglicans are not saved because they are teaching a false paradigm of salvation too (see article 27 of the <a href="http://www.anglicanchurch.net/media/Articles_of_Religion_1571.pdf" target="_blank"><i>The Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion
Church of England (Anglican)</i></a>)</p>
</aside>

If the conclusion is that, according to conservative, evangelical churches, Martin Luther taught a false paradigm of salvation, the implications are far-reaching, but that is the topic for another post.<sup>6</sup>
