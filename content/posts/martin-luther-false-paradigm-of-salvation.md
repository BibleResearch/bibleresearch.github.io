This is part of a series on [salvation](https://bible.hightower.space/tags/salvation/) and how men can be saved.

# Preface and Warning

By way of preface, I would like to voice some warnings:

First, I'm confused. If you're looking for what the Bible says about how sinful man can be reconciled to a Holy God, this is not a blog post that will answer that question and I sincerely ask you to stop reading.

Second, asking questions like the ones that follow make me feel like a child wading into the Pacific Ocean with the intention of swimming across it. I proceed with such apparent foolishness for three reasons:

A. I firmly believe God is so magnificent and glorious that it would be better to sink quietly into unfathomable depths, lungs filled with suffocating saltwater, having caught a glimpse of glory than to spend a long, leisurely life safely on the shore without a glimmer of God.

B. I do not think I can continue to live an intellectually vibrant and honest life without addressing these questions. I cannot ignore them and pursue a vibrant intellect; I cannot settle for partial, unsatisfying answers and have an honest intellect. No matter how inadequate I feel in this endevour, I must fight to achieve the prize or die in the attempt. It simply must be done.

C. I proceed to, as it were, swim across the Pacific because I hope, as millennias of men have testified, that there is a gracious, triune God able to rescue those drowning in the depths of His word and character. We must never forget that theological questions are an attempt to sketch out the dimensions of realities now obscure to us. Theology has an object... and that object is living, powerful, and awesome! We must never be so short-sighted as to read the Bible and forget that the same God who inspired these words still lives. He is not dead! He has not died nor has His will ever been challenged by the whims of men. I swim because it's worth it. I swim because I must. I swim knowing that there is a gracious triune God who is able to deliver, but even if He does not, I will still hope in Him.

Third, do not assume I know what I'm talking about; please validate my claims. If what I'm saying does not make sense to you, please [let me know](https://hightower.space/contact/). I feel my biblical knowledge is, if translated to physical dimensions, about the size of a child; my theological knowledge about the size of a house-cat; my knowledge of church history akin to an ant. So be warned; I am not an expert on any of the topics I discuss or mention below.

With all that said by way of warning, I now proceed to one of my questions.

# My Question: Did Martin Luther Teach a False Paradigm of Salvation?

I believe that the logical implications of what is taught in some conservative, evangelical churches necessarily leads us to the conclusion that Martin Luther, the revered reformer whose face likely appears on posters in such churches and whose slogans and statements are regularly quoted, taught a false paradigm of salvation. That is, Martin Luther taught a falsehood on one of the most important issues in the Bible (salvation) which qualifies him as a false teacher with the Roman Catholic Church.

My conclusion proceeds from the following tenets which are held and promulgated<sup>1</sup> by many conservative, evangelical churches with which I am familiar.

<aside class="marginnote">
  <span class="noteNumber">1</span> - To be clear, I do not, necessarily, agree with the tenents. I'm simply saying that these tenents are believed and taught.
</aside>

In simple form, the logical structure of the argument is:

1. "A" teaches "x" as a paradigm of salvation.
2. "x" is false.
3. Conclusion from 1 - 3: "A" teaches a false paradigm of salvation.
4. "B" also teaches "x" (or at least something very similar to "x") as a paradigm of salvation.
5. Conclusion from 2 and 5: "B" teaches a false paradigm of salvation.

In longer form, the argument goes:

1. The Roman Catholic Church teaches the following on baptism as a necessity for salvation:

    > "The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation. He also commands his disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to baptize them. Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament. The Church does not know of any means other than Baptism that assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are "reborn of water and the Spirit." God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments."<sup>2</sup>

2. The Roman Catholic Church's teaching on baptism is wrong because it "teaches its adherents to trust in the things that they do in order to eventually achieve salvation" which is contrary to Ephesians 2:8-9<sup>3</sup>.

    </aside>

3. Therefore (concluded from premise 1 and 2): the Roman Catholic Church teachers a false paradigm of salvation.
4. Martin Luther (*after* his departure from the Roman Church) held a view on baptism that is similar to the Roman Catholic Church. This is evidenced by his *[Small Catechism](https://catechism.cph.org/en/sacrament-of-holy-baptism.html)* where he says:

    > "What benefits does Baptism give?
    > 
    > It works forgiveness of sins, rescues from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare."<sup>4</sup>

5. Therefore (concluding from premise 2 and 5): Martin Luther taught a false paradigm of salvation.

</aside>

To be clear, I do not, necessarily, believe the conclusion above and I do not believe you should believe it on grounds of my argument alone. I'm simply provoking thought by making implied arguments explicit. Is my logic wrong? Are my facts and/or interpretation of those facts wrong? Are we honestly comfortable saying that Martin Luther was a false teacher preaching a false paradigm of salvation?
