# Preface

This is part of a series on [salvation](https://bible.hightower.space/tags/salvation/) where I posed questions on how men can be saved.

Before continuing, I encourage you to read the warning [here](/posts/2020-warning/).

# Martin Luther on Baptism and Salvation

## Background

In a [previous post](/posts/martin-luther-false-paradigm-of-salvation/) I made the argument that, if conservative, evangelical churches argue that Roman Catholics are not saved because of their beliefs about baptism, this logically and necessarily implies that Martin Luther also taught a false gospel because he held similar beliefs about baptism as the Roman Catholic Church.

I laid out my argument in logical form with three premises and two conclusions. I think the weakest point of the argument is premise #4 which reads:

> Martin Luther (*after* his departure from the Roman Church) held a view on baptism that is similar to the Roman Catholic Church.

and is followed by a quote from Luther's [*Small Catechism*](https://catechism.cph.org/en/sacrament-of-holy-baptism.html). Although I don't think this premise is very weak, I do think it is the *weakest* premise and would like to provide a broader view of Luther's thoughts on baptism from his [*Large Catechism*](http://bookofconcord.org/lc-6-baptism.php).

## Luther on Baptism and Salvation in His Large Catechism

### Baptism is an Institution of God

In his *Large Catechism*, Luther opens the section on [baptism](http://bookofconcord.org/lc-6-baptism.php) by saying (emphases added):

> We have now finished the three chief parts of the common Christian doctrine. Besides these we have yet to speak of our two Sacraments instituted by Christ, of which also every Christian ought to have at least an ordinary, brief instruction, because without them there can be no Christian; although, alas! hitherto no instruction concerning them has been given. But, in the first place, we take up Baptism, <u>by which we are first received into the Christian Church</u>. However, in order that it may be readily understood, we will treat of it in an orderly manner, and keep only to that which it is necessary for us to know. For how it is to be maintained and defended against heretics and sects we will commend to the learned.
> 
> In the first place, we must above all things know well the words upon which Baptism is founded, and to which everything refers that is to be said on the subject, namely, where the Lord Christ speaks in Matthew 28:19:
> 
> > > Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
> 
> Likewise in St. Mark 16:16:
> 
> > > He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
> 
> In these words you must note, in the first place, that here stand God's commandment and institution, lest we doubt that Baptism is divine, not devised nor invented by men. For as truly as I can say, No man has spun the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer out of his head, but they are revealed and given by God Himself, <u>so also I can boast that Baptism is no human trifle, but instituted by God Himself</u>, moreover, that it is most solemnly and strictly commanded that <u>we must be baptized or we cannot be saved</u>, lest any one regard it as a trifling matter, like putting on a new red coat. For it is of the greatest importance that we esteem Baptism excellent, glorious, and exalted, for which we contend and fight chiefly, because the world is now so full of sects clamoring that Baptism is an external thing, and that external things are of no benefit. But let it be ever so much an external thing, here stand God's Word and command which institute, establish, and confirm Baptism. But what God institutes and commands cannot be a vain, but must be a most precious thing, though in appearance it were of less value than a straw. If hitherto people could consider it a great thing when the Pope with his letters and bulls dispensed indulgences and confirmed altars and churches, solely because of the letters and seals, we ought to esteem Baptism much more highly and more precious, because God has commanded it, and, besides, it is performed in His name. For these are the words, Go ye, baptize; however, not in your name, but in the name of God.

He then goes on to discuss how baptism is an act of God in which, quoting Augustine, "Accedat verbum ad elementum et fit sacramentum" or "when the Word is joined to the element or natural substance, it becomes a Sacrament, that is, a holy and divine matter and sign".<sup>1</sup> He argues against those who view baptism as solely an external act by saying that because God has commanded baptism for salvation, God works in a special way through and in the physical process of baptism.

### Baptism Saves

Then, having established *what* baptism is, he turns to *why* (for what purpose) it exists. He says this:

> In the second place, since we know now what Baptism is, and how it is to be regarded, <u>we must also learn why and for what purpose it is instituted; that is, what it profits, gives, and works</u>. And this also we cannot discern better than from the words of Christ above quoted: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved". <u>Therefore state it most simply thus, that the power, work, profit, fruit, and end of Baptism is this, namely, to save. For no one is baptized in order that he may become a prince, but, as the words declare, that he be saved. But to be saved, we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil, and to enter into the kingdom of Christ, and to live with Him forever.</u><sup>2</sup>

#### Does This Deny "Faith Alone"? (Hint: Not for Luther)

Luther continues and addresses the modern, conservative, evangelical position which argues that "faith alone" eschews any so-called works or external actions (which would include baptism):

> But as our would-be wise, new spirits assert that faith alone saves, and that works and external things avail nothing, we answer: It is true, indeed, that nothing in us is of any avail but faith, as we shall hear still further. <u>But these blind guides are unwilling to see this, namely, that faith must have something which it believes, that is, of which it takes hold, and upon which it stands and rests. Thus faith clings to the water, and believes that it is Baptism, in which there is pure salvation and life; not through the water (as we have sufficiently stated), but through the fact that it is embodied in the Word and institution of God, and the name of God inheres in it. Now, if I believe this, what else is it than believing in God as in Him who has given and planted His Word into this ordinance, and proposes to us this external thing wherein we may apprehend such a treasure?</u>
> 
> Now, they are so mad as to separate faith, and that to which faith clings and is bound, though it be something external. <u>Yea, it shall and must be something external, that it may be apprehended by the senses, and understood and thereby be brought into the heart, as indeed the entire Gospel is an external, verbal preaching.</u> In short, what God does and works in us He proposes to work through such external ordinances. <u>Wherever, therefore, He speaks, yea, in whichever direction or by whatever means He speaks, thither faith must look, and to that it must hold. Now here we have the words: He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. To what else do they refer than to Baptism, that is, to the water comprehended in God's ordinance? Hence it follows that whoever rejects Baptism rejects the Word of God, faith, and Christ, who directs us thither and binds us to Baptism.</u><sup>3</sup>

</aside>

If I am understanding Luther correctly, he is saying that the faith which saves is faith *in* God and God's revealed means of salvation (viz. baptism).

#### Is Baptism a Work? (Hint: Not for Luther)

As Luther continues, he addresses *who* can receive the blessings of baptism. He says:

> But if they say, as they are accustomed: Still Baptism is itself a work, and you say works are of no avail for salvation; what, then, becomes of faith? Answer: <u>Yes, our works, indeed, avail nothing for salvation; Baptism, however, is not our work, but God's (for, as was stated, you must put Christ-baptism far away from a bath-keeper's baptism).</u> God's works, however, are saving and necessary for salvation, and do not exclude, but demand, faith; for without faith they could not be apprehended. <u>For by suffering the water to be poured upon you, you have not yet received Baptism in such a manner that it benefits you anything; but it becomes beneficial to you if you have yourself baptized with the thought that this is according to God's command and ordinance, and besides in God's name, in order that you may receive in the water the promised salvation.</u> Now, this the fist cannot do, nor the body; but the heart must believe it. Thus you see plainly that there is here no work done by us, but a treasure which He gives us, and which faith apprehends; just as the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross is not a work, but a treasure comprehended in the Word, and offered to us and received by faith. Therefore they do us violence by exclaiming against us as though we preach against faith; while we alone insist upon it as being of such necessity that without it nothing can be received nor enjoyed.<sup>4</sup>

</aside>

In short, baptism is not, in Martin Luther's mind, a work that we do to achieve our salvation; it is a divinely ordained work of God in which we participate with faith.

#### Martin Luther's Recap on Baptism

Martin Luther closes the section on baptism with these words:

>  Therefore every Christian has enough in Baptism to learn and to practise all his life; <u>for he has always enough to do to believe firmly what it promises and brings: victory over death and the devil, forgiveness of sin, the grace of God, the entire Christ, and the Holy Ghost with His gifts</u>. In short, it is so transcendent that if timid nature could realize it, it might well doubt whether it could be true. For consider, if there were somewhere a physician who understood the art of saving men from dying, or, even though they died, of restoring them speedily to life, so that they would thereafter live forever, how the world would pour in money like snow and rain, so that because of the throng of the rich no one could find access! <u>But here in Baptism there is brought free to every one's door such a treasure and medicine as utterly destroys death and preserves all men alive.</u>
>  
> <u>Thus we must regard Baptism and make it profitable to ourselves, that when our sins and conscience oppress us, we strengthen ourselves and take comfort and say: "Nevertheless I am baptized; but if I am baptized, it is promised me that I shall be saved and have eternal life, both in soul and body".</u> For that is the reason why these two things are done in Baptism, namely, that the body, which can apprehend nothing but the water, is sprinkled, and, in addition, the word is spoken for the soul to apprehend. Now, since both, the water and the Word, are one Baptism, therefore body and soul must be saved and live forever: the soul through the Word which it believes, but the body because it is united with the soul and also apprehends Baptism as it is able to apprehend it. <u>We have, therefore, no greater jewel in body and soul, for by it we are made holy and are saved, which no other kind of life, no work upon earth, can attain.</u>
> 
> Let this suffice respecting the nature, blessing, and use of Baptism, for it answers the present purpose.<sup>5</sup>

Martin Luther views baptism as the means by which Christians have "victory over death and the devil, forgiveness of sin, the grace of God, the entire Christ, and the Holy Ghost with His gifts". He also views baptism as the ground of our assurance of salvation.

# Conclusion

With this blog post, I rest my case that Martin Luther has a very similar view on baptism as that expressed by the Roman Catholic Church (e.g. [CCC #1257](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1257.htm)). Martin Luther, famous for coining the phrase 'Sola Fide', did not use that phrase as many modern, conservative, evangelicals; he believed, with the Roman Catholic Church, that baptism is the means by which sins are forgiven and entrance into heaven is secured.

As I said in my [first post on Martin Luther's teachings on baptism](/posts/martin-luther-false-paradigm-of-salvation/), the implications of this are far-reaching, but we will deal with the facts first and the implications later.
