title: Dealing with Doubts
date: 2018-07-05
description: "If you have found yourself serving in the Church, following Christ, and studying His word only to find yourself confronted with formidable questions and doubts, it can be a paralyzing experience. What do you do? Do you keep studying the book you have so many questions about? Do you keep serving in the Church? In this post, I offer some principles for dealing with doubts and questions in a productive, God-honoring way."

Here are some practical principles I have come up with:

- Don't wallow in doubt
- Don't stay isolated (and don't isolate yourself)
- James 1: With respect to God's word: Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry
- Pray like crazy! - Follow the example of David, James 1, Jesus, and the Apostles
- Trust God's sovereignty
- Address the issues head-on
- When in doubt, trust the boundaries and means of Grace God has given
- No friendly-fire! Don't burn bridges between you and those with whom you disagree. Even if you disagree about something that you think is very important (and it may well be *extremely* important), don't let this produce anger or bitterness between you and that person.
