# The Danger

When defining the Gospel, I often hear people conflate a correct response to the Gospel or the effects of the Gospel with the content of the Gospel itself. This is dangerous and inaccurate for (at least) two reasons:

- It confuses pragmatism and function with ontology (there is more on the danger of Pragmaticism [here](https://bible.hightower.space/posts/pragmaticism/)).
- It includes consequences in the definition rather than just the grounds. This breaks a basic principle of creating definitions, namely "that the attributes included in the definition should be always such as are the ground of the others rather than the consequences"<sup>1</sup>.

# How to Define the Gospel Well

I believe a safer approach to defining the Gospel is, what is often termed, a "word-study" approach which looks at the uses of the word "εὐαγγέλιον"<sup>2</sup> in the New Testament. A good passage to start defining the Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:3-8.
