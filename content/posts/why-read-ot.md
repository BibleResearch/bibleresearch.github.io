For the time being, I'm going to answer this question by looking at what the New Testament says about the Old Testament. So what does the New Testament have to say about the Old Testament?

The Old Testament...

1. predicts/points to Christ (Luke 24:44-47)
2. is sufficient to bring about salvation (Luke 16:19-31 (especially 29-31), 2 Timothy 3:15)
3. was written for our instruction (Romans 15:4, 1 Corinthians 10:11, Luke 17:32)
4. was written for our encouragement (Romans 15:4)
5. (as part of scripture) is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17)
6. is fulfilled in/by Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20)
