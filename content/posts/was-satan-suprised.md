Was Satan surprised...
too busy looking at Job to see Jesus?

too busy deceiving the eves to notice the ave...
maria who, through no merit of her own and though a sinner such as I, was blessed to bring into the fallen, dirty world one who, in ages past, had made the oceans whirl and rivers swirl?

Was Satan surprised...
too busy roaming about on the earth?

too busy building Babel to notice a babe in Bethlehem...
who, by submission to His Fatherâ€™s will and because of His great love with which He loved us, would bless sinners with reconciliation and an inheritance?

Was Satan surprised... I certainly am.
