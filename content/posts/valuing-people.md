The following was originally written on December 10, 2014:

People are so important! 1 Peter has been one of the defining books in my life recently. I have gleaned so many treasures from this little book and, although I am constantly unearthing new and beautiful truths, it is hard for me to think of any book as being more applicable to believers today than 1 Peter. I especially love the end of chapter 1 where Peter encourages us to fervently love one another (1 Peter 1:22) because we are of imperishable seed (1 Peter 1:23-25) and, just like the imperishable word of God (1 Peter 1:24-25), believers are also of this imperishable nature.

I believe it was Howard Hendricks who once said that there are two things that are eternal and that is men (their souls) and the word of God. Our lives (time, energy, money, investment, focus, attention, love, passion) should reflect these two eternal, imperishable things.
