What a shame that a Christian college recently had to shut down its foreign languages department due to a lack of interest. At this college, learning Koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew is highly honored, as it should be; yet Spanish, French, Chinese, and German classes are a thing of the past due to lack of demand.

I find it tragic that in our haste to understand the bible we often forget that part of our calling is to communicate the truth we discover. Keep studying Greek and Hebrew to better understand the bible, but we must also be equipping ourselves to communicate biblical truth to a dying world that doesn't always speak English.
