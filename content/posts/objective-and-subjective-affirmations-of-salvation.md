The following is based on a recent discussion I had with some friends. It is more for me than anyone else. You've been warned. My thoughts in this post are pretty scattered, likely unfounded, and undoubtedly questionable. Candidly, I don't think I fully understand the distinction between Objective and Subjective grounds, so I am probably misrepresenting the view, but have not yet had time to clarify what is meant by this distinction.

When asked about assurance of salvation<sup>1</sup>, some people appeal to a distinction between objective and subjective grounds for assurance. Objective grounds include the reality of the incarnation, life, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Subjective grounds include my love for Christ and my works.<sup>2</sup> This blog post details some of my objections to this view. I write primarily as a means of clarifying what I believe and to further the discussion.

<aside class="marginnote">
  <p><span class="noteNumber">1</span> - Namely, how can someone know that he or she is saved (a true believer)?</p>
  <span class="noteNumber">2</span> - To be clear, these things are subjective to us. From God's perspective, they are objective, but from my perspective they are subjective.
</aside>

I have the following issues with the distinction between objective and subjective grounds for salvation:

A. This dichotomy appears to have no basis in scripture (either implicitly or explicitly). In fact...

B. The biblical authors tightly weave what are normally classified as "objective" grounds in with "subjective" grounds which, in my estimation, implies that they did not hold to the same dichotomy we are proposing. For example, consider the book of 1 John where the apostle John weaves the objective (e.g. 1 John 1, 3:1, 4:19) with the subjective (e.g. 1 John 3:4-10 and 4:20-21).<sup>3</sup>

<aside class="marginnote">
  <span class="noteNumber">3</span> - The response to this objection will likely be that the interweaving of the objective and subjective proves a 'tension'. If by tension, you mean 'mixture', then I am comfortable with that, but it seems to me that a mixture ruins the whole idea of a dichotomy.
</aside>

C. If the reformer's paradigm of noticia, assensus, and fiducia is true, at least one of the necessary components of saving faith (fiducia (and probably assensus too)) is purely subjective. Thus, it appears that assurance of salvation is fundamentally based on the subjective.

D. If the objective/subjective dichotomy is accepted, the argument goes that there is a tension between the sides of the dichotomy, but that the objective side can give us hope and empower perseverance on our bad days (when the subjective grounds aren't looking too hot). In other words, the subjective grounds are subordinate to the objective grounds. If there is a disagreement between the two, the objective wins. Is there biblical (or otherwise founded) basis for this?<!-- <sup>4</sup> -->

<!-- <aside class="marginnote">
  <span class="noteNumber">4</span> - This reminds me of C.S. Lewis's "*Meditation in a Toolshed*" where he discusses the difference between looking along the light and at the beam of light. To answer the question, I think a solid argument that the subjective is subordinate to the objective can be made based on the limitations of human perception. This falls apart, however, in the case where a believer is having a bad day and would like to appeal to the objective rather than the subjective because in this case the problem is not a limitation of perception, but the fact that the objective grounds are more comfortable than the subjective grounds for the time being.
</aside> -->

E. Even if the objective/subjective dichotomy is accepted, assurance of salvation still rests, and must rest, on the subjective. Indulge me while I explain... The logic that brings me to this conclusion proceeds as follows:

  - Premise 1: If my possession (or anyone's possession) of saving faith were objective, we would not even be asking the question about assurance of salvation.
  - Conclusion 1: Therefore, from premise 1, I conclude that whether or not I have saving faith must fall within the "subjective" grounds of assurance (this is true, of course, from my, human perspective; God knows the answer to be sure, but from my limited perspective it is subjective). In other words, the fact that I think that I have saving faith is a subjective ground for my actually having saving faith.
  - Premise 2: Demons affirm the objective grounds for assurance.
  - Premise 3: Demonic faith is not the same as saving faith.
  - Conclusion 2: Therefore, any assurance of my salvation must rest solely on the subjective grounds of salvation. Anything a demon can do is not sufficient ground for assurance of salvation (because demons are not saved). If you're concerned with this logic, consider James 2:14-26. In it, James raises the question: How do you know whether or not you have demonic faith? And answers it with: You have good works attendant with faith (see especially James 2:19-24).
