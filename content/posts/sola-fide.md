"Sola Fide" (meaning "only faith" or "faith alone") has become one of the hallmark phrases of the reformation. In this blog post, I'm going to ask some questions about the phrase "Sola Fide" and answer them primarily from Romans 3:21-26. The questions will help us both break down the concept itself and consider its mechanics.

### What is faith?

To understand "Sola Fide", we must start by understanding what we mean by "Fide" (in English: "faith"). Outside of the Bible, faith is defined as "*a confidence, belief, or trust in something or someone*". Notice that there are really three components to faith. First, there is a positive belief which we hold. Second, there is an object of the faith. Faith is also *in* something or someone. And third, it is essential that the object in which the faith is placed is not visible to the one with the faith. If I see a cat outside of my window, I may certainly believe that there is a cat outside of my window, but this does not constitute faith because I am *seeing* it. So what does faith mean in the Bible?

In the Bible, the word "faith" is used in three different ways. When we say "Sola Fide" we are referring to faith as belief in God's revelation. To prove this, consider two passages on opposite sides of the Bible and separated from one another by thousands of years: Genesis 15:6 and 1 Peter 1:8-9. In Genesis 15:6, we find that Abraham "believed in the LORD and He reckoned it to him as righteousness". In the preceding verses, God reiterates and extends His promise to Abraham by promising that Abraham himself will have a child with Sarai even in their old age. Abraham believed in God's promise and this was credited or counted to him as righteousness by God. In 1 Peter 1:8-9, we find Peter in the midst of encouraging the believers to persevere through trials because this tests and proves they have true faith. In verse eight and nine, we find that one aspect of faith is loving and trusting in God even through trials and even though we have not seen God. This is faith; believing in God and holding to His promises even though we haven't seen Him or the fulfillment of His promises.

### What does "Sola Fide" accomplish?

Now let's jump back to Romans 3:21-26 to look at what faith does in the life of one who believes. According to Romans 3:21-22, faith is the means by which we receive the righteousness of God. Look at verse 22:

> "even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe;"

Notice a couple truths from this passage. First, we are talking about the righteousness *of God*! This is nothing less than the complete and full perfection found in Jesus Christ. Second, this righteousness is available *to us* through "faith in Jesus Christ"! Jesus's perfection is counted toward those who believe. If we have the very righteousness of God, this means that we now have peace with God and stand before Him in the purity of Christ (see Romans 5:1-2). Thus, faith in Christ accomplishes our salvation! It is by faith that we have access and right to stand before God covered in Christ's righteousness. The next question considers the object of saving faith.

### Faith in what?

As I mentioned when defining faith, faith must have an object; that is, faith is always placed *in* something. When we talk about the saving faith described by the phrase "Sola Fide", in what are we putting our faith? According to Romans 3:22, faith that justifies us is that faith which is *in* Jesus Christ. There are two aspects of this faith that are important to define. First, this faith is placed in the reality of who Christ is and what Christ accomplished. Namely that He came as one person with two natures (one fully divine and one fully human), was crucified on a cross to take God's wrath in our stead, was buried, resurrected on the third day, and ascended to God's right hand where He remains until He returns. Second, saving faith is not just an intelectual assent to the historical validaty of Christ's existence, but is also a recognition and belief in the consequences of what Christ accomplished in human history. In other words, faith is placed in the historical events we call the Gospel and also the theology of what Christ accomplished. Saving faith is placed in Jesus Christ. To whom does this great salvation apply?

### To whom does "Sola Fide" apply?

As Paul says in Romans 3:22b-23:

> "for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God..."

The distinction to which Paul is referring is the distinction between Jew (those with the law) and Gentile (those without the law). To see this, look back at the preceeding section in Romans 3:9-20. In this section, Paul establishes that Jews are also sinners along with the Gentile (see Romans 3:9). Thus Paul establishes in Romans 3:22-23 that the righteousness of God is a requirement for everyone (both Jew and Gentile) and is available to everyone. Thus, we can summarily answer this question by saying that salvation by faith applies to anyone who is a sinner.

At this point, we have established that faith is believing God and His promises. We have also established that saving faith is placed in Jesus Christ and the result of this faith is the righteousness of God being imparted to the one who believes. Up to this point, we have been focused on the "Fide" part of the statement "Sola Fide", but now let's consider why the word "Sola" was added.

### "Sola Fide" as opposed to what? (i.e. What else would someone think it would be?)

First, why did the reformers feel the need to add "Sola" in front of "Fide"? It implies that someone might be inclined to think that the righteouness of God is accessible by another means. What means might that be? Paul's original audience would have been tempted to think that the righteouness of God was accessible through the law. Paul eliminates this as a means to the righteousness of God, however, in verse 21 by saying that this righteousness is available "apart from the law". Then the implication of verse 23 is that there is no means by which man can be justified by his own works because he is utterly sinful.

The righteousness of God is available by faith alone because of man's sinfulness. If both Jews and Gentiles are sinners, there are absolutely no means by .

### Why is it faith *alone*?

The righteousness of God is available .

### How long has justification been through faith?
