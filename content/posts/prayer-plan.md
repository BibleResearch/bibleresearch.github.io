I use it as a system for guiding my prayer life and I hope you find it helpful. Feel free to modify it as you see fit.

# Basics

There are two basic parts of this system:

1. Prayer items
2. Bible passages

The idea is that you split up your prayer items over a week and will have a specific Bible passage to guide your prayer each week. For example, let's say you have a friend named Martha and you want to pray for her. In this system, you would pick a day of the week on which to pray for her (e.g. Monday). Thus, you will pray for Martha every Monday. Additionally, each week there is a passage of scripture to guide you thoughts and prayers. For example, one week it might be 1 Thessalonians 1:2-7. The next week, it might be 2 Peter 3:17-*18*. These passages help you know the Bible more and can help guide your prayers for Martha. In the next section, I'll describe how to get started with this process.

# Getting Started

So let's get started! The first step is to list out all of the people, organizations, and other topics that you want to be praying for.

## Prayer Items

As you list out everything you want to be praying for, this list will probably get rather large. That's fine. It can include anything; family, friends, coworkers, personal requests, etc.

Next, print out or draw a calendar or table like the one [here](https://www.calendarlabs.com/templates/blank/monthly-calendar-landscape-color-sunday.pdf) (you can also use a task app that lets you create recurring tasks).

Now, split up the requests through the days of the week. You can group them (e.g. put requests for family members together on certain days of the week) or can spread out similar requests throughout the week (e.g. put a request or two for family members on every day throughout the week).

Now you have a prayer plan! This will help you pray for a lot of people in a disciplined, systematic way.

## Bible Passages

The last step is to choose a Bible passage to guide and enrich your prayers. I recommend you choose this passage at the beginning of every week. The goal is to find a passage of the Bible which helps guide root your prayers in the truth of scripture. For example, if I were praying in light of 1 Thessalonians 1:2-4, I would be praying for believers on my list that God would grow their faith and trust in God so that they can do the "work of faith". Likewise for the "labour of love" and "steadfastness of hope". I would be praying that God would grow their love and perseverance in light of what Christ has done for us. I would also praise God for His choice to save each of the believers (see verse 4). For those who have not repented of their sins and turned to follow Christ, I would be praying that God would work in their hearts to change their hearts and bring them to saving faith so that they too can show the same faith, love, and perseverance discussed in this passage.

Below is a list of good Bible passages for guiding prayer. It is by no means exhaustive. Some of the passages focus on who God is. Others are a praise or admonition from one of the New Testament letters.
