All it takes is a quick email, phone call, or even a text. Or better yet... next time you see them, take some time to let them know how much you appreciate what they do for you. It is *really* hard to be a teacher and is often a thank-less endeavour which can get depressing over time. Even a short word of thanks can go great lengths to encourage your teacher. Consider **Galatians 6:13**:

> The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches

We need to develop a culture where teachers challenge students to grow and where students *encourage* teachers to keep challenging them. As a professor of mine once said:

> Teachers are not producers and students are not consumers.

The best growth and learning occurs when both teachers *and* students are engaged in the teaching/learning process.

All of these principles also apply to student-teacher relationships outside of the Church, but especially those within the Church.

Find someone you appreciate and say "Thank you"!
