This is part of a series called [Practical Spiritual Disciplines](../practical-spiritual-disciplines-why) in which I will be discussing *how* to practice the spiritual disciplines.

# The Questions

The Bible is often called "God's word", but have you stopped to think about what this means? If the Bible contains the divinely inspired words of God as it claims (2 Timothy 3:14-16, 2 Peter 1:16-21), *How can we make Bible study a regular part of our lives?*. Once we have done this, *How do we read the Bible well?*. That is, *What should we be looking for in the Bible and how should we interpret it accurately and faithfully?*.
