Many definitions of prayer boil down to something like: "Talking to God". I love this definition. The focus and emphasis, however, is often placed on the "talking" (i.e. our action in prayer). Certainly, this is important, but we must also recognize that it is the God to whom we are praying that separates our prayers from the prayers of Muslims, Hindus, and Mormons. People of many religions pray. What fundamentally differentiates Christian prayer from prayer in other religions is the character and nature of the God of the Bible. The God of the Bible, because of His attributes, is the God that makes prayer possible. Prayers to other ‘gods’ must differ as the character and nature of the 'god(s)' changes.

# Closing Prayer

Triune God, we praise You for Your character and attributes. We praise You for Your compassion (1 Peter 5:7) and sovereignty over the entire universe (Matthew 6:9-13). Thank You for hearing our prayers!

Our Father who is in heaven,
Hallowed be Your name.
Your kingdom come.
Your will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
