I was reading Galatians 5:13 recently and this jumped out at me:

> For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.

In our efforts to glorify God and fight sin, one helpful strategy that I pull from this verse is to be busy serving one another. This has the dual benefits of keeping you busy and focusing your efforts on serving Christ and His church. I challenge you to consider how you can use the freedom you have in Christ to serve His church rather than yourself.
