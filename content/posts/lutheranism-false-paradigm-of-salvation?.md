# Preface

This is part of a series on [salvation](https://bible.hightower.space/tags/salvation/) where I posed questions on how men can be saved.

Before continuing, I encourage you to read the warning [here](/posts/2020-warning/).

# Lutheranism on Baptism and Salvation

## Background

In previous posts ([part 1](/posts/martin-luther-false-paradigm-of-salvation/) and [part 2](/posts/martin-luther-false-paradigm-of-salvation-2/)) I made the argument that, if conservative, evangelical churches argue that Roman Catholics are not saved because of their beliefs about baptism, this logically and necessarily implies that Martin Luther also taught a false gospel because he held similar beliefs about baptism as the Roman Catholic Church.

In this post, I cite a few more sources used within Lutheranism as a whole.

## Augsburg Confession

In the [Augsburg Confession of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Confession), it says this about baptism:

> <u>Of Baptism they teach that it is necessary to salvation, and that through Baptism is offered the grace of God, and that children are to be baptized who, being offered to God through Baptism are received into God's grace.</u>
> 
> They condemn the Anabaptists, who reject the baptism of children, and say that children are saved without Baptism.<sup>1</sup>

## Confutatio Augustana

The Roman Catholic Church responded to the Augsburg Confession with the [Confutatio Augustana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confutatio_Augustana) saying, with regard to the teaching on baptism quoted above:

> The ninth article, concerning Baptism - <u>viz. that it is necessary to salvation, and that children ought to be baptized - is approved and accepted</u>, and they are right in condemning the Anabaptists, a most seditious class of men that ought to be banished far from the boundaries of the Roman Empire in order that illustrious Germany may not suffer again such a destructive and sanguinary commotion as she experienced five years ago in the slaughter of so many thousands.<sup>2</sup>

From my interpretation of this, it appears that the Roman Catholic Church *agreed* with Lutherans on this issue.

## Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification

In the more recent [Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Declaration_on_the_Doctrine_of_Justification), the Roman Catholic Church and Lutherans affirm:

> <b>4.3 Justification by Faith and through Grace</b> <u>We confess together that sinners are justified by faith in the saving action of God in Christ. By the action of the Holy Spirit in Baptism, they are granted the gift of salvation, which lays the basis for the whole Christian life.</u> They place their trust in God's gracious promise by justifying faith, which includes hope in God and love for him. Such a faith is active in love and thus the Christian cannot and should not remain without works. But whatever in the justified precedes or follows the free gift of faith is neither the basis of justification nor merits it.<sup>3</sup>

# Conclusion

As in previous posts, my intention is not to draw any conclusions or implications from the citations above. I'm simply trying to point out that the logic used in some conservative, evangelical churches disqualifies Lutherans (and probably others) from salvation based on their teaching. Whether this is right or wrong is another question, but I hope my logic is valid.

In future posts, I hope to examine Anglicanism's teachings on baptism.
