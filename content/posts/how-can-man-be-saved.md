This blog post contains what I consider to be big, weighty questions (with very few answers). If you choose to keep reading, please skim this post first: [https://bible.hightower.space/posts/2020-warning/](https://bible.hightower.space/posts/2020-warning/).

What must I do to be saved?

Seriously, what must I do to be saved? I'm so confused and overwhelmed by a whirl-wind of comments and responses on this question (both from inside and outside the Bible) that I honestly don't know what the answer is right now. One of the key questions in this whole discussion is: What do we mean by the word "saved"? But, I'll address that at a later date. For now, I'll define "saved" as: spending eternity with God in heaven and, later, the News Heavens and New Earth.

Here are some Bible passages and the main command which, by some people's interpretations of the passage, answers the question of how someone can be saved:

[1] This passage can be interpreted in a way that does not make this criteria *necessary* for salvation, but it certainly *guarantees* salvation

[2] Here it appears to be the belief which is saving or condemning, not the baptism

[3] I don't think this passage is intended as normative, but it deals with the subject of how to be saved/have sins forgiven (which may or may not be the same thing), so I included it

[4] I'm not sure if this had to do directly with salvation

[5] Interpretations of this passage vary, but Jesus makes it clear that whatever this means, it is required to enter the kingdom of God

Whew, that's a lot of verses... I'll conclude with two thoughts/questions. First, it is frustrating to me when conservative, evangelicals say things like "You just need to believe Jesus to be saved". What does that mean? And besides that, a number of passages listed above seem to indicate that there is something more than belief which is required. Second, if you or anyone distills the Gospel proclamation down to a simple phrase like "believe Jesus" or "believe in Jesus" or "repent and believe", why are you (or the person making the claim) choosing only those criteria as the ones necessary for salvation? Again, it seems like Jesus is clear that there are a number of things required to spend eternity with God. If you're going to take one verse in isolation (e.g. John 3:16), why are you doing that? Should we not also consider the rest of Jesus' words?

Anyway, that's all for now. I'd like to dig more rigorously into each of these passages in the future and see which ones I interpret as actually being necessary for salvation, but that will have to wait.
