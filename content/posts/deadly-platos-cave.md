For the past year, going to church and reading the bible has felt like this:

I am shackled in Plato's cave. I am periodically given enough 'food' to live (I say 'food' because some of it is inedible or undesirable (raw, rotting meat, bones, lard, etc.)), but getting the food is difficult because the shackle on my neck has small protrusions or hooks on the inside designed to create small lacerations on my neck if I strain against the shackle too much. The food is put just at the limit of my shackle. In order to get food, I must strain against the shackle and receive lacerations on my neck. If these lacerations become too many or too deep, I will bleed to death. If I don't strain for the food and receive the lacerations, however, I will starve to death.

My life has become a tense balancing act between two deaths. On one side, I lay sated and bleeding to death; on the other side, I lay starving to death and healed. It appears I have no choice but to balance myself between these two deaths. I must sometimes go for the life-giving, healing food. I must sometimes not go for the food. I must sometimes not suffer the lacerations of my shackles. I must sometimes suffer the lacerations of my shackles.

It is killing me to get the very thing I must have to live. If I don't get what I need to live, I will die. If I get what I need to live, it will kill me.
