Welcome to the Bible Research website! This is a site I have been working on for a while as a place to find helpful resources for reading, studying, understanding, and applying the Bible.

I hope you enjoy! If you have any feedback, questions, or comments, feel free to [contact me](https://hightower.space/contact/). If you find these resources helpful, please [say thanks](https://saythanks.io/to/fhightower)... it is very encouraging!
