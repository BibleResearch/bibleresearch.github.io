<p>This is part of a series called <a href=../practical-spiritual-disciplines-why>Practical Spiritual Disciplines</a> which is designed to show you <em>what</em> tools and activities God has given us to grow and <em>how</em> we can practices these disciplines in our daily lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are far too easily pleased.”</p>
<p>~ C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=definition>Definition</h1>
<p>A spiritual discipline is an activity, which ought to be a habit, that the Bible prescribes for Christians to help them grow spiritually. The idea that there are activities which believers ought to be doing to help them grow is not a modern idea. It is found in scripture in numerous locations.</p>
<h1 id=biblical-basis-for-spiritual-disciplines>Biblical Basis for Spiritual Disciplines</h1>
<p>The idea of spiritual disciplines comes from the Bible. In Philippians 2:12-13, Paul exhorts his readers to &ldquo;work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who is at work in your both to will and to work for His Good pleasure&rdquo;. Far from a call to passively acknowledge the truths expressed earlier in chapter 2, Paul is calling his flock to &ldquo;work out&rdquo; their salvation in light of the theological truths he just discussed. Whatever Paul has in mind here, &ldquo;work out&rdquo; sounds like something intentional and habitual. In 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22, Paul encourages his flock to get in the habit of doing certain things (and not doing others). &ldquo;rejoice <em>always</em>&rdquo;, pray <em>without ceasing</em>", and &ldquo;in <em>everything</em> give thanks&rdquo; (emphases added). In Paul&rsquo;s mind, there are habits that ought to characterize followers of Jesus Christ which should flow from our new spiritual life in Christ (see John 3:3) and should help us grow spiritually.</p>
<h1 id=examples>Examples</h1>
<p>Even if you have never heard the phrase &ldquo;spiritual disciplines&rdquo; before, you are certainly familiar with some examples. Some of the spiritual disciplines we&rsquo;ll be discussing in this series are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bible reading/study (see Hebrews 5:11-14, 1 Timothy 3:2, 3:9, and 2 Timothy 2:15)</li>
<li><a href=../practical-spiritual-disciplines-prayer>Prayer</a> and Fasting (1 Thessalonians 5:17, Ephesians 6:18, Colossians 4:12, 1 Peter 3:7, Matthew 6:9-13, Acts 13:2-3, 1 Peter 4:7, and Daniel 9:3-4)</li>
<li>Serving the Church (1 Peter 4:7-11 and Ephesians 4)</li>
<li>Tithing (see 1 Timothy 6:17-19 and 2 Corinthians 9:7)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other spiritual disciplines given in scripture, but these are the main ones we&rsquo;ll be focusing on. Again, we will be answering questions like &ldquo;How do I develop this habit?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do I practice this discipline in my life?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s going to be good!</p>
