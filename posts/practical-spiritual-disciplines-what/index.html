<p>I&rsquo;m starting a series called &ldquo;Practical Spiritual Disciplines&rdquo; (there is an introduction <a href="../practical-spiritual-disciplines-why">here</a>) in which I will be discussing <em>how</em> to practice the spiritual disciplines. Before I do this, however, I figured I had better define what I mean by a &ldquo;spiritual discipline&rdquo; and that is the subject of this post.</p>

<h1 id="definition">Definition</h1>

<p>A spiritual discipline is an activity, which ought to be a habit, that the Bible prescribes for Christians to help them grow spiritually. The idea that there are activities which believers ought to be doing to help them grow is not a modern idea. It is found in scripture in numerous locations.</p>

<h1 id="biblical-basis-for-spiritual-disciplines">Biblical Basis for Spiritual Disciplines</h1>

<p>The idea of spiritual disciplines comes from the Bible. In Philippians 2:12-13, Paul exhorts his readers to &ldquo;work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who is at work in your both to will and to work for His Good pleasure&rdquo;. Far from a call to passively acknowledge the truths expressed earlier in chapter 2, Paul is calling his flock to &ldquo;work out&rdquo; their salvation in light of the theological truths he just discussed. Whatever Paul has in mind here, &ldquo;work out&rdquo; sounds like something intentional and habitual. In 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22, Paul encourages his flock to get in the habit of doing certain things (and not doing others). &ldquo;rejoice <em>always</em>&rdquo;, pray <em>without ceasing</em>&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in <em>everything</em> give thanks&rdquo; (emphases added). In Paul&rsquo;s mind, there are habits that ought to characterize followers of Jesus Christ which should flow from our new spiritual life in Christ (see John 3:3) and should help us grow spiritually.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>

<p>Even if you have never heard the phrase &ldquo;spiritual disciplines&rdquo; before, you are certainly familiar with some examples. Some of the spiritual disciplines we&rsquo;ll be discussing in this series are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bible reading/study</li>
<li>Prayer</li>
<li>Fasting</li>
<li>Serving the Church</li>
</ul>

<p>There are others given in scripture, but these are the main ones we&rsquo;ll be focusing on. Again, we will be answering questions like &ldquo;How do I develop this habit?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How do I practice this discipline in my life?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s going to be good!</p>
