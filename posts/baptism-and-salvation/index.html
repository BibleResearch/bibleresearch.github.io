<p>Three evidences from scripture that baptism is not necessary for salvation.</p>

<section id=post-body>
<p>There are some passages in scripture which appear, at first glance, to be saying that baptism is necessary for salvation (for example Mark 16:16, Acts 2:37-38, Galatians 3:27). In reformed, protestant circles, there are counter-arguments given for all of these passages (which I think are convincing and have sound Biblical grounds). I here present, however, three evidences from scripture that salvation does not require baptism. I would be curious how someone who believes that baptism is required for salvation would respond (you can <a href=https://hightower.space/contact/>contact me</a> if you are such a person).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:10-17 doesn&rsquo;t argue that baptism is necessary for salvation. In this passage, Paul treats baptism as a means of possible contention and never mentions it as a means to salvation. If baptism were necessary for salvation, would Paul say this in 1 Corinthians 1:17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel&mldr;&rdquo;"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Acts 10, Cornelius and his family (Gentiles) hear the gospel for the first time. Notice the order of events; the Holy Spirit falls on them (10:44-46) and <em>then</em> they are baptized (10:48). Let me make two observations on this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. I posit that the Holy Spirit falling on those who were listening was evidence that they were saved (see Romans 8:9 and Ephesians 1:13). Peter, in Acts 11:1-18, affirms this sequence of events in saying &ldquo;Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also <em>after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ</em>&mldr;&rdquo; (Acts 11:17 - emphasis added). Because the evidence of salvation (the Holy Spirit) comes upon them before baptism, it must be true that, at least under some circumstances, salvation does not require baptism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>B. The order of events described in this passage (Belief -> Holy Spirit -> Baptism) does not align with what Peter says in Acts 2:38 (Repentance -> Baptism -> Holy Spirit). Because of this, it appears that neither Acts 2:38 nor Acts 10:44-48 should be read as a normative template for salvation without the support of the rest of scripture.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of the rest of scripture, there are numerous passages in scripture that do not mention baptism as part of salvation. For example, Genesis 15:6, Habakkuk 2:4, John 1:12, 3:1-21 (especially 3:16 and 3:18), 3:33-36, Acts 16:30-34, Romans 1:16-17, Galatians 3:11-14, Ephesians 2:8-9, Hebrews 10:35 - 11:40. If you are going to claim that baptism is required for salvation, you have to explain why each of these passages leaves out a necessary part of salvation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>UPDATE (July 1, 2018):</strong> Building off of the second point above, let me also point out what Peter says in his sermon in Acts 3:19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my mind, this demonstrates:</p>
<p>A. Peter didn&rsquo;t view baptism as necessary for salvation (he doesn&rsquo;t mention it in this passage).
B. Peter&rsquo;s statements in Acts 2:38 are not to be considered normative.</p>
