                <p>A few thoughts on prayer.</p>
                <section id="post-body">
                    

<p>In studying prayer recently, I have a few more thoughts that did not find a home among the other writings on prayer. I have captured them below in no particular order other than the sequence in which they were brought to mind.</p>

<h1 id="pray-for-your-enemies">Pray for Your Enemies</h1>

<p>Let us not forget that we are called to &ldquo;love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&rdquo; (Matthew 5:44). Notice a couple of things here. First, let it sink in that we are called to pray for those who hate, malign, and persecute us. This is a high calling! We are to be pleading before God for salvation of all men; even those who hate us. Second, notice that there is a parallel structure to Jesus&rsquo;s statement. The phrase &ldquo;love your enemies&rdquo; is parallel with &ldquo;pray for those who persecute you&rdquo;. I surmise from this that prayer is an act of love. Another way of saying &ldquo;love your enemies&rdquo; is to say &ldquo;pray for those who persecute you&rdquo;. Who is our enemy but the one who persecutes us and how can we love them but to pray for them. Keep this in mind; prayer is a powerful, effective act of love.</p>

<h1 id="the-role-of-the-holy-spirit-in-prayer">The Role of the Holy Spirit in Prayer</h1>

<p>Throughout scripture, the Holy Spirit is closely related to prayer. In my <a href="/tags/prayer/">discussions on prayer</a>, I have left this point largely unexplored and would be remiss if I did not discuss it at least once. I&rsquo;ll start in the Old Testament. The prophetic promise of the Holy Spirit to Israel in Zechariah 12:10 is tied to prayer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the Spirit of grace and of supplication&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is also tied to prayer for Christians. After teaching His disciples to pray in Luke 11:1-4, Jesus then proceeds to give an analogy emphasizing the goodness and willingness of God in giving &ldquo;the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him&rdquo; (Luke 11:1-13). Romans 8:26 says that the Holy Spirit, through whom we have intimacy with the Father (see Romans 8:14-15), &ldquo;intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words&rdquo;. Both Ephesians 6:18 and Jude 20 encourage believers to pray &ldquo;in the [Holy] Spirit&rdquo;. Clearly, the Holy Spirit is involved in helping us to pray in a way that aligns with God&rsquo;s will and glorifies Him. In fact, it would be worthwhile to consider how each person of the trinity is involved in prayer, but that is a topic for another time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good isaac watt&rsquo;s quote on pg. 120 - direction 1</p></li>

<li><p>2 cor. 12:6 -&gt; is this an AI hermenuetic? If not, should this lead us to be covenental? (see pg. 126 of guide to prayer)</p></li>

<li><p>jude 19 - those w/o HS are fleshly - proof, in conjunction w/ the fact that Conrelious wasn&rsquo;t baptised before receiving the HS in acts 10, that baptism doesn&rsquo;t save - more on the role of the HS on pg. 131 of &ldquo;Guide to prayer&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>great quotes on prayer on pg. 169 (in fact, the final chapter is wonderful)</p></li>

<li><p>blog post on what to do when you don&rsquo;t feel like praying</p></li>
