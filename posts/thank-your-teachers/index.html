                    <p>This week, take some time to thank a teacher or mentor you appreciate.</p>

<p>All it takes is a quick email, phone call, or even a text. Or better yet&hellip; next time you see them, take some time to let them know how much you appreciate what they do for you. It is <em>really</em> hard to be a teacher and is often a thank-less endeavour which can get depressing over time. Even a short word of thanks can go great lengths to encourage your teacher. Consider <strong>Galatians 6:13</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to develop a culture where teachers challenge students to learn and grow and where students <em>encourage</em> teachers to keep challenging them. As a professor of mine once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teachers are not producers and students are not consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best growth and learning occurs when both teachers <em>and</em> students are engaged in the teaching/learning process.</p>

<p>All of these principles also apply to student-teacher relationships outside of the Church, but especially those within the Church.</p>

<p>Find someone you appreciate and say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; now!</p>
